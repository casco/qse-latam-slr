  abstract={Quantum key distribution (QKD) is regarded as an alternative to traditional cryptography methods for securing data communication by quantum mechanics rather than computational complexity. Towards the massive deployment of QKD, embedding it with the telecommunication system is crucially important. Homogenous optical multi-core fibers (MCFs) compatible with spatial division multiplexing (SDM) are essential components for the next-generation optical communication infrastructure, which provides a big potential for co-existence of optical telecommunication systems and QKD. However, the QKD channel is extremely vulnerable due to the fact that the quantum states can be annihilated by noise during signal propagation. Thus, investigation of telecom compatibility for QKD co-existing with high-speed classical communication in SDM transmission media is needed. In this paper, we present analytical models of the noise sources in QKD links over heterogeneous MCFs. Spontaneous Raman scattering and inter-core crosstalk are experimentally characterized over spans of MCFs with different refractive index profiles, emulating shared telecom traffic conditions. Lower bounds for the secret key rates and quantum bit error rate (QBER) due to different core/wavelength allocation are obtained to validate intra- and inter-core co-existence of QKD and classical telecommunication.},

  abstract={Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) have important applications in cryptographic protocols, games, and lotteries, among others. In contrast with software-based pseudorandom number generators, the number sequence generated is truly random. Most QRNGs found in the literature are based on single-photon sources and detectors. In this letter, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a QRNG that uses only one single-photon detector and weak coherent or thermal states as light source.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the feasibility of a quantum-secure Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) in hardware constrained Smart Meter (SM) equipment. In this sense, the Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices (CRYSTALS)-Kyber scheme, the new standard for post-quantum Public-Key Encryption (PKE) systems chosen by the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process, is scrutinized and implemented in a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. Experimental results show that the proposed hardware/software co-design implementation of the CRYSTALS-Kyber scheme in an SoC FPGA device reduces its execution time by around 70% compared to its software implementation. Moreover, the hardware resource analysis shows that the proposed hardware/software co-design implementation of the CRYSTALS-Kyber scheme in an SoC device is feasible for SM equipment.},

  title={Manta Ray Foraging Optimization Approaches on Multivariable PID Controller Tuning}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This work presents a performance comparison between the newly developed Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) and two different variants created for tuning a decentralized fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) application. The application consists of a ball mill pulverizing system to pulverize coal and maximize fuel efficiency. MRFO and its applications have the task of finding the optimal controller variable values to control the system's temperature and pressure. The MRFO is a metaheuristic based on the behavior of manta rays, and although it shows efficient performance it may be improved through the use of techniques which generate new variants of the algorithm. Two techniques were used in the de-velopment of new variants: Quantum mechanics and opposition-based learning. The three different versions of MRFO were used to minimize a custom fitness function which is a combination of the integral time squared error (ITSE) and the overshoot of the system response. Simulations were carried using Simulink and Matlab softwares. For analyzing the performances, statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, best, mean, median, and standard deviation of the fitness function over 50 runs were used. Additionally, the different variants were also compared for minimizing 10 benchmark functions. The results show that the use of the previously mentioned techniques improve the performance of the original MRFO in optimizing the FOPID to control the ball mill pulverizing system.},

  title={A Portable Surface Plasmons Resonance Sensor Based on Single-Board Computer}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The development of portable surface plasmons resonance (SPRs) are recently boosted by the use of instrumentation based on small-size single-board computer (SBC) platforms. The SPR and SBC combination is ideal for advances in direction of miniaturization and portability, however many scientific and engineering solutions yet required a computer connection for operation, and reported portable sensors in which hardware and software resources are misused. Here a standalone portable SPR based on an SBC is presented. The sensor operates without the need for another device, computer, or connection. Designed to work with thicker (3 mm thick) or thin (1.5 mm) biochips to support surface plasmons (SPs) and avoid rotational parts, a set of special structures was designed to encapsulate all electronics and optical elements. Composed of modular parts manufactured in a 3-D printer, the proposed arrangement enables quick maintenance and repair actions, eventually required for field applications. The chassis piece enclosure the components and fit the touchscreen. A replaced top cover piece enables the exchange of the thicker- and thin- biochips. And a back lid gives access to the internal components, where moving parts are designed and included to improve mechanical alignment. The sensor was optimized to Raspberry Pi SBC. The Python-based embedded software implements algorithms for acquiring, processing, displaying, storing, and delivering the SPR responses. To demonstrate the solution feasibility a Raspberry pi 3 model B was used. The well knows biochips PPBIO (Prism BIOchip) (thicker) and diffractive optical coupling element (DOCE) (thin) were attached to the proposed SBC-SPR Sensor. Those biochips dismissed index-matching gels and rotate parts, which benefits the sensing labor cost. Experiments of aqueous solutions were performed with a sensor operating in the so-called angular interrogation mode (AI mode). The results indicate the capability of phenomena excitation and sensor arrangement. The sensitivity figure-of-merit (FOM) was achieved in the order of 160°/RIU, similar to the performance of traditional set-up for those biochips.},

  title={Delay Estimation of Industrial IoT Applications Based on Messaging Protocols}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={67},
  number={9},
  pages={2188-2199},
  abstract={Information and operational technologies merge into the so-called industrial Internet of Things, which is one of the basic pillars of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. Roughly speaking, yet-to-come services will be offered in the automation scenario by industrial devices having an internet connection for sharing data in the cloud. Currently, most efforts are in the development of protocols able to ensure horizontal interoperability among heterogeneous applications. Consequently, poor attention is devoted to time-related performance. In this paper, a new, full software, platform-independent approach is proposed for experimentally evaluating the delay in transferring information across local and intercontinental routes by applications leveraging on messaging middleware. The application is realized using the node-RED web-based framework, due to its availability on different platforms; the widely accepted message queue telemetry transport protocol has been chosen thanks to its low overhead and complexity. For sake of completeness, five different, private and public, brokers are used. The adopted industrial-grade hardware, complemented by global positioning system time reference, permits an overall synchronization and timestamping accuracy of a few milliseconds. The vast measurement campaign highlighted that, generally, quality of service (QoS) type 1 offers low end-to-end delay (average value less than 0.5 s) with reduced variability (0.1 s). However, the maximum end-to-end one-way delay ranges from 1 s for QoS 0 to less than 1.5 s for fully acknowledged QoS 2.},

  title={Information-Theoretically Secure String Commitments Based on Packet Reordering Channels}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={139928-139945},
  abstract={Realizing fundamental cryptographic primitives with unconditional security is a central topic in information-theoretic cryptography. These primitives can be realized based on physical assumptions, such as the existence of noisy channels, an upper bound on the storage capacity, or the laws of quantum mechanics. Palmieri and Pereira [1] demonstrated that delays in communication channels can be used as a reasonable and effective assumption to obtain an unconditionally secure oblivious transfer protocol against honest-but-curious adversaries. While any oblivious transfer protocol secure against malicious adversaries can be used to implement commitment, the reduction does not work if the oblivious transfer protocol is only secure against honest-but-curious adversaries. Thus, the question of obtaining a secure commitment protocol based on channel delays is still open. In this paper, we provide a concrete protocol for implementing string commitments based on packet reordering – a consequence of channel delays in packet networks.},

  title={Securing Smart Meters Through Physical Properties of Their Components}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={70},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={This article presents a security strategy to protect smart meters against attacks that compromise critical electronic components. Many of these attacks consist of stealing energy by manipulating smart meters' measurements. For example, a malicious entity can replace or tamper with components that execute measuring procedures and store sensitive parameters. This type of attack is common on devices, such as smart meters, that are part of environments considered hostile, where attackers have easy access to the device. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques in which physical manipulations on smart meters by attackers are unsuccessful. Our strategy uses physical properties from these components to create secure identities for the meter. We present two main contributions. The first one is inspired by physical unclonable functions and extracts unique identifiers from SRAM components. Then, we combine these identifiers to create a strong identity. The other contribution uses physical context information from the voltage levels in the smart meter's power supply to yield dynamic context identities. We also validate our proposals in experiments using a hardware prototype that embeds Arduino microprocessors, SRAM memories, and voltage sensors. The results show that our idea is suitable for implementation in real smart meters and can help protect these devices from attacks against their components.},

  abstract={The increasing demand for sustainable energy generation has often pointed to solar energy as an exceedingly promising alternative. A new procedure to harvest solar energy is using solar rectennas, which are composed of micro-sized antennas and nano diodes. This configuration allows the capture and conversion of electromagnetic energy into direct current. The challenges in developing this technology arise as the wave frequency increases to terahertz spectrum, causing metals to no longer exhibit perfect electrical conductivity (PEC) behavior, and diodes deviate from classical modeling, approaching more towards quantum model. Within this context, this work presents an investigative study on a novel solar rectenna designed to operate at 30 THz. It consists of a micro-bowtie antenna and a geometric diode, both constructed using graphene as conducting material. The antenna is designed using classical electromagnetic theory employing CST software. For the diode, a parametric study is conducted to seek the optimal I-V relationship. Given the complexity and time demands of quantum analysis, an approach utilizing the Monte Carlo method is proposed. The novelty of this approach lies in the time discretization process, triggered only when a collision occurs between the electrons and the rectifier boundaries.},

  title={Real-Time B-Spline Interpolation for Harmonic Phasor Estimation in Power Systems}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The fundamental component synchrophasors are widely used nowadays, based on the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs), in several applications in electrical power systems. For the advancement of monitoring technology, harmonic synchrophasor estimation is still a challenge. To make it possible, it is necessary to correctly estimate the harmonic phasor (magnitude and phase of each harmonic component), mainly in scenarios with frequency deviations and noise. In this context, this present article proposes the use of B-spline-based interpolation as a preprocessing algorithm for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The performance is evaluated in terms of total vector error (TVE) considering the tests proposed by the IEEE C37.118.1 and IEC 60255-118-1 standards and compared with four different harmonic phasor estimation (HPE) methods, the HPE, sinc interpolation function-based estimator (SIFE), Taylor–Fourier transform (TFT), and flat-top finite impulse response (FT FIR). The proposed method can provide a TVE below 1% for all harmonic phasors, from the first to the fiftieth order, under significant frequency deviation. Also, for real-time validation, the proposed method was implemented in an industrial computer as a software routine capable of processing the signals in real time. The signals are acquired by a commercial merging unit (MU) and the samples are published using the IEC 61850 sampled values (SVs) protocol.},
