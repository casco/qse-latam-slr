  abstract={Nowadays, very small entities have a large presence in the software industry in any country where on average they represent 94% (+/− 3%). Therefore, these types of companies have the need to implement quality models and standards. In this context, a standard oriented to these environments has been created: ISO/IEC 29110. This has made it possible to provide good practices to increase the quality of software products and services. However, quality should not only be qualitative but quantitative through the use of metrics. Therefore, this article proposes metrics for software development based on the ISO/IEC 29110 standard. To validate the proposed metrics, a project submitted by a software development company to obtain certification in 2020 was analyzed.},

  abstract={At Sandia National Laboratories, QSCOUT (the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed) is an ion-trap based quantum computer built for the purpose of allowing users low-level access to quantum hardware. Commands are executed on the hardware using Jaqal (Just Another Quantum Assembly Language), a programming language designed in-house to support the unique capabilities of QSCOUT. In this work, we describe a batching implementation of our custom software that speeds the experimental run-time through the reduction of communication and upload times. Reducing the code upload time during experimental runs improves system performance by mitigating the effects of drift. We demonstrate this implementation through a set of quantum chemistry experiments using a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). While developed specifically for this testbed, this idea finds application across many similar experimental platforms that seek greater hardware control or reduced overhead.},

  abstract={Nowadays, very small entities are very important in the software product and service development sector. Therefore, it is necessary to implement models and / or standards that allow obtaining a certification in this type of company. For this, a standard has been created, such as the ISO/IEC 29110 standard. However, as in medium-sized or large companies, very small entities face problems such as lack of knowledge, trained personnel and experience in the implementation of this type of norms. Therefore, this article proposes the GPIS tool that allows evaluating the processes based on the ISO / IEC 29110 standard and the project to be presented for a future certification. To validate the GPIS tool, it was implemented in an Academic Software Development Center (CDS) prior to starting a certification process in the ISO/IEC 29110 standard. After the implementation of GPIS the certification of the standard ISO / IEC 29110 was obtained.},

  abstract={Internet of Things acts an essential role in our everyday lives and it definitely has the potential to grow on the importance and revolutionize our future. However, the present communication technologies have several security related issues which is required to provide secure end to end connectivity among services. Moreover, due to recent, rapid growth of quantum technologies, most common security mechanisms considered secure today may be soon imperilled. Thus, the modern security mechanisms during their construction also require the power of quantum technologies to resist various potential attacks from quantum computers. Because of its characteristics, quantum walks (QW) is considered as a universal quantum computation paradigm that can be accepted as an excellent key generator. In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61%, and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks.},

  abstract={Quadratic pseudo-Boolean functions (i.e., quadratic functions with real-valued coefficients and two-valued variables) are the native input to quantum annealers and also a common problem format to optimize with the QAOA algorithm on circuitmodel quantum computers. In both cases, large, complex optimization problems can be expressed in terms of combinations of simpler problems. A key challenge in problem set-up lies in finding the coefficients for the constituent sub-problems. These need to be chosen such that the function is minimized on valid inputs and is higher elsewhere. One difficulty is that it is not possible in general to solve for a sub-problem’s coefficients without introducing ancillary variables, the number of which and their corresponding per-row values being unknown a priori. These unknowns lead to solving for a sub-problem’s coefficients being an NP-complete problem.In this paper we present a simple heuristic that considers a prioritized subset of the exponential number of possibilities for each per-row ancillary variable. Using this heuristic, coefficients can be found substantially faster than would be possible using a brute-force search and with less software complexity than is required by prior approaches.},

  year={2022},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The CIGSe thin film solar cell (TFSC) has been attracted to photovoltaic technologies for energy production due to its favorable material properties. This research work introduces the SCAPS software to model the CIGSe TFSC. From the simulated results, the solar cell performance was enhanced with an increase in thickness of the CIGSe by improving the absorption of photons. The recombination centers for the generated charge carriers were increased at higher carrier concentrations of the CIGSe. The efficiency was slightly improved when CdS thickness is increased from 20 to 100 nm. The collection of generated charge carriers was enhanced with a rise in carrier concentration of CdS, which increases the device performance. After analyzing these results, the optimized efficiency of 27.32% was noticed for CIGSe TFSC. The quantum efficiency (QE) results confirmed that the photons whose wavelength value lower than 900 nm are absorbed in the device. Moreover, the experimental results of CIGSe and CdS thin films are studied in this simulation. It was observed that the device’s performance was reduced with an increase in the thickness of the CdS. Hence, SCAPS software could be useful for designing the device experimentally.},

  abstract={One of the manifestations of the knowledge society is the increase in areas of uncertainty, transforming ignorance, understood as the ignorance of non-knowledge, into uncertainty, understood as the knowledge of non-knowledge. Knowledge management and strategic intelligence are transformative activities of society, implicitly connected with innovation in sustainability and business changes that result in greater organizational potential, and in a knowledge economy. The objective of Intelligence is to obtain value from data and information by analyzing a large amount of data. Mining and mineral extraction processes are a sector that due to its complexity requires tools for decision-making that ensure efficiency and competitive position without forgetting the stakeholders. Therefore, this study performs a conceptual and bibliometric analysis of production in the area of Knowledge Management and Intelligence quantifying performance indicators, identifying the main research areas and authors, and evaluating the development of the knowledge field using VOSviewer as bibliometric analysis software.},

  year={2021},
  volume={70},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={To establish the RF power traceability up to 50 GHz in Mexico by means of a primary standard for microwave power and millimeter-wave power, a new coaxial microcalorimeter system in 2.4-mm line size along with thermoelectric-type transfer standards (TSs) were developed and their metrological characterization was performed. Coaxial microcalorimeters allow both broadband operation and power substitution through its feeding line; however, characterization and fabrication of millimeter-wave coaxial lines are technologically difficult. Thus, the design of the microcalorimeter is described, as well as the RF performance of its adiabatic lines. To overcome the lack of coaxial TSs up to 50 GHz, commercially available 2.4-mm thermoelectric power sensors are investigated to use them as low-frequency (LF) power substitution detectors. The effective efficiency is measured in the microcalorimeter by means of calorimetric measurements and the substitution of LF power; the developed measurement procedure is presented as well as the measurement results and the uncertainty analysis. The theoretical basis for the procedure employed to determine the microcalorimeter correction factor, based on the use of specially constructed open and short standards, is described with the measurement results and uncertainties are shown as well. To avoid the drift of the millimeter-wave power during the calorimetric measurements, a novel software leveling loop method for thermoelectric power sensors was devised. This method allows to keep the RF power level variations less than 100 ppm and being a straightforward solution to recent complex hardware realizations.},

  year={2019},

  pages={558-565},
  abstract={This paper describes the metrological characterization of a new type-N coaxial microcalorimeter and its associated thermistor-type transfer standard, which together are used as the primary standard for microwave power from 0.05 to 18 GHz at the Centro Nacional de Metrología, Queretaro, Mexico. The design characteristics, evaluation method, and measurement uncertainties of the primary standard are given and compared to recent realizations found in the open literature. The metrological characterization of the microcalorimeter is based on a comparison method to indirectly obtain its correction factor. The effective efficiency of the transfer standard, directly calibrated in the microcalorimeter by means of calorimetric measurements, is shown and compared against measurements performed by National Institute of Standards and Technology, showing good agreement within the estimated expanded uncertainties (0.21%-0.47%). The developed data acquisition system to automate the effective efficiency measurements and the proposed software leveling loop to keep the microwave power level constant are also discussed. This approach allows to keep an RF power stability of better than 100 ppm over several hours and is a straightforward solution to replace analog leveling systems which require obsolete hardware. Finally, the analysis followed to evaluate the uncertainty for the effective efficiency measurements is thoroughly described.},
