Therefore, early classification of it is a crucial task. Quantum machine learning and quantum neural network models can play an effective role in multiclass classification problems. Compared to standard deep and machine learning classifiers, the quantum variational classifier may lead to less memory usage, accuracy, and portability for respiratory disease detection. This article proposes a hybrid respiratory lung disease detection framework based on classical CNN and Quantum classifiers. It combines a classical deep feature extraction model with quantum classifiers. A new custom convolutional neural network (CCNN) deep learning model is proposed to perform feature extraction, and the Multi-Multi-Single (MMS) & Multi-Single-Multi-Single (MSMS) are proposed as quantum machine learning algorithms. These two quantum classifiers are built via a quantum variational circuit with encoding, entanglement, and measurement properties. The tests were carried out on the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset (CRD), which contains 15,153 chest X-ray images of COVID-19, Viral, and Normal. The experimental results revealed that the proposed model had the highest training and testing accuracy of 98.9% and 98.1%, on the CRD dataset, with a computation cost of 0.07 and 0.08 respectively. This hybrid model performs better than the other standard deep learning models. Additionally, we validated our MMS and MSMS quantum classifiers by deploying them on the IBM Q-QASM real-time quantum computer. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction; Quantum classifier; Quantum machine learning; Qubits","Biological organs; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Statistical tests; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Features extraction; Human respiratory system; Hybrid framework; Learning models; Machine-learning; Quantum classifier; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; classifier; comparative study; conceptual framework; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; cost; covid 19 radiography dataset; deep learning; encoding; entanglement; experimental model; feature extraction; hybrid framework; lung disease; machine learning; measurement; memory; multi multi single algorithm; multi single multi single algorithm; multiclass classification; nonhuman; physical parameters; quantum classifier; quantum mechanics; quantum variational circuit; radiological parameters; residual neural network; thorax radiography; training; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174329402"

By partitioning the electron density using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, we demonstrated a very good transferability of the group polarizabilities. We were able to identify and extract the most efficient functional groups capable of generating the largest electrical susceptibility in condensed phases. Both the isotropic polarizability and its anisotropy were used to understand the way functional groups act as sources of linear optical responses, how they interact with each other reinforcing the macroscopic optical behavior within the material, and how covalent bonds and non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, determine refractive indices and birefringence. Particular attention is devoted to the peptide bonds as they provide links to build biomacromolecules or polymers. An adequate quantum–mechanical treatment of at least the first interaction sphere of a given functional group is required to properly describe the effects of mutual polarization, but we identified optimum cluster size and shape to better estimate polarizabilities and dipole moments of larger molecules or molecular aggregates from the knowledge of the electron density of a central molecule or amino acid residual that is representative of the bulk. The strategy outlined here is a fast yet effective tool for estimating the optical properties of proteins but could eventually find application in the rational design of optical organic materials as well. Methods: Electronic-structure calculations were performed on the Gaussin16 program at the DFT level using the CAMB3LYP functional and the double-ζ quality Dunning basis set aug-cc-pVDZ. Electron density partitioning followed the concepts of the Quantum Theory of Atoms and Molecules (QTAIM) and was performed using the AIMAll program. The locally developed Polaber routine was applied to calculate dipole moment vectors and polarizability tensors. It was amended to include the effects of the local field on a given central molecule by means of a modified Atom-Dipole Interaction Model (ADIM). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biomacromolecule; Density functional theory; Peptide; Polarizability; Quantum theory of atoms in molecules","Amino Acids; Electricity; Glycine; Peptides; Proteins; amino acid; diglycine; functional group; glycine; hydrogen; pentaglycine; pentapeptide; peptide; polymer; polypeptide; tetraglycine; triglycine; unclassified drug; protein; anisotropy; Article; chemical interaction; controlled study; covalent bond; density functional theory; dipole; electron; hydrogen bond; macromolecule; neutron diffraction; optics; polarization; prediction; predictive value; quantum chemistry; quantum theory; electricity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146536492"

Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to capture this gas. Then, the present work analyzed the temperature effect in CO2 absorption through deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on urea and choline chloride using an in silico approach. The Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that the increased temperature reduced the interaction potential of carbon dioxide molecules with the DESs components, indicating that the absorption process is more favorable at 303 K. On the other hand, the Noncovalent Interactions (NCI) simulations suggest that the increased temperature reduced the strong attractions and increased repulsive interactions between the carbon dioxide molecules with the solvent analyzed.

The model combines low-cost quantum mechanical calculations with QSAR methodology and linear regressions to achieve accurate predictions for a broad range of nitrogen-containing compounds. The model was developed using a diverse dataset of 130 nitrogenous compounds and exhibits excellent predictive performance, with a high coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.9905, low standard error (s) of 0.3066, and high Fisher statistic (F) of 2142. The model outperforms existing methods, such as Chemaxon software and previous studies, in terms of accuracy and its ability to handle heterogeneous datasets. External validation on pharmaceutical ingredients, dyes, and supramolecular complexes based on cucurbiturils confirms the reliability of the model. To enhance usability, a script-like tool has been developed, providing a streamlined process for users to access the model. This study represents a significant advancement in pK a prediction, offering valuable insights for drug design and supramolecular system optimization.

Prompted by the theoretical and practical developments in computational chemistry, this led to the emergence of biomolecular simulations and, along with the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, to the development of hybrid QM/MM methods. QM/MM methods are necessary whenever the problem we want to address involves chemical reactivity and/or a change in the system’s electronic structure, with archetypal examples being the studies of an enzyme’s reaction mechanism and a metalloprotein’s active site. In the last decades QM/MM methods have seen an increasing adoption driven by their incorporation in widely used biomolecular simulation software. However, properly setting up a QM/MM simulation is not an easy task, and several issues need to be properly addressed to obtain meaningful results. In the present work, we describe both the theoretical concepts and practical issues that need to be considered when performing QM/MM simulations. We start with a brief historical perspective on the development of these methods and describe when and why QM/MM methods are mandatory. Then we show how to properly select and analyze the performance of the QM level of theory, the QM system size, and the position and type of the boundaries. We show the relevance of performing prior QM model system (or QM cluster) calculations in a vacuum and how to use the corresponding results to adequately calibrate those derived from QM/MM. We also discuss how to prepare the starting structure and how to select an adequate simulation strategy, including those based on geometry optimizations as well as free energy methods. In particular, we focus on the determination of free energy profiles using multiple steered molecular dynamics (MSMD) combined with Jarzynski’s equation. Finally, we describe the results for two illustrative and complementary examples: the reaction performed by chorismate mutase and the study of ligand binding to hemoglobins.

Quantum algorithms (QAs), engage the rules of quantum mechanics to solve problems using quantum information, where the quantum information is concerning the state of a quantum system, which can be manipulated using quantum information algorithms and other processing techniques. Nowadays, many QAs have been proposed, whose general conclusion is that using the effects of quantum mechanics results in a significant speedup (exponential, polynomial, super polynomial) over the traditional algorithms. This implies that some complex problems currently intractable with traditional algorithms can be solved with QA. On the other hand, DL algorithms offer what is known as machine learning techniques. DL is concerned with teaching a computer to filter inputs through layers to learn how to predict and classify information. Observations can be in the form of plain text, images, or sound. The inspiration for deep learning is the way that the human brain filters information. Therefore, in this research, we analyzed these two areas to observe the most relevant works and applications developed by the researchers in the world. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Control; Deep learning; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent; Medicine; Neural networks; Quantum computing; Robotic","Deep learning; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Information use; Learning algorithms; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Deep learning; Fuzzy-Logic; Information algorithms; Intelligent; Neural-networks; Processing technique; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum Information; Quantum system; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128926778"

Quantum simulations, simulation of chemical reactions, solution of optimization problems and quantum neural networks (QNNs) are some examples. However, problems such as noise, limited number of qubits and circuit depth, and gradient vanishing must be resolved before we can use them to their full potential. In the field of quantum machine learning, several models have been proposed. In general, in order to train these different models, we use the gradient of a cost function with respect to the model parameters. In order to obtain this gradient, we must compute the derivative of this function with respect to the model parameters. One of the most used methods in the literature to perform this task is the parameter-shift rule method. This method consists of evaluating the cost function twice for each parameter of the QNN. A problem with this method is that the number of evaluations grows linearly with the number of parameters. In this work, we study an alternative method, called evolution strategies (ES), which are a family of black box optimization algorithms which iteratively update the parameters using a search gradient. An advantage of the ES method is that in using it, one can control the number of times the cost function will be evaluated. We apply the ES method to the binary classification task, showing that this method is a viable alternative for training QNNs. However, we observe that its performance will be strongly dependent on the hyperparameters used. Furthermore, we also observe that this method, alike the parameter shift rule method, suffers from the problem of gradient vanishing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Binary classification; Evolution strategies; Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks; Quantum neural networks","Function evaluation; Iterative methods; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Binary classification; Classical neural networks; Cost-function; Evolution strategies; Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; Modeling parameters; Parameter shifts; Quanta computers; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Cost functions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149185118"

Understanding how QNN properties (for example, the number of parameters M) affect the loss landscape is crucial to designing scalable QNN architectures. Here we rigorously analyze the overparametrization phenomenon in QNNs, defining overparametrization as the regime where the QNN has more than a critical number of parameters M c allowing it to explore all relevant directions in state space. Our main results show that the dimension of the Lie algebra obtained from the generators of the QNN is an upper bound for M c, and for the maximal rank that the quantum Fisher information and Hessian matrices can reach. Underparametrized QNNs have spurious local minima in the loss landscape that start disappearing when M ≥ M c. Thus, the overparametrization onset corresponds to a computational phase transition where the QNN trainability is greatly improved. We then connect the notion of overparametrization to the QNN capacity, so that when a QNN is overparametrized, its capacity achieves its maximum possible value. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","Algebra; Fisher information matrix; Critical numbers; Fisher information matrices; Hessian matrices; Lie Algebra; Local minimums; Network properties; Neural network architecture; Quantum neural networks; State-space; Upper Bound; Computation theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163409954"

These integrals are useful in both non−relativistic and relativistic calculations of many−electron systems. They involve hyper−geometric functions that are practically difficult to compute. Relationships free from hyper−geometric functions for expectation values of Coulomb potential (r21−1) are derived. These relationships are new and show that the complication coming from two−range nature of Laplace expansion for the Coulomb potential is removed. This is achieved by utilizing auxiliary functions represented in finite power series. They serve as essential components in deriving straightforward recurrence relationships for electron repulsion integrals. In the context of computing the expectation values of potentials with arbitrary power, the methodology presented here for evaluation of these integrals forms the initial condition. It is also adapted to multi−center integrals.

External routines/libraries: Nemo, a computer algebra package for the Julia programming language [3], JRAF, a Julia package for computation of relativistic molecular auxiliary functions [4]. Nature of problem: Definite integrals involving higher transcendental functions given by, fmn1(a,b,x)=xm−1e−bxΓ[n,ax], and fmn2(a,b,x)=xm−1e−bxγ[n,ax] are frequently encountered in atomic physics, with the electron repulsion integral being a notable illustration. For exclusive solutions to these integrals, one can refer to Erdélyi's [5] or Gradshteyn and Ryzhik's [6] books. The solutions are obtained by using the series representation of incomplete gamma functions. The result is hyper−geometric functions of the form F12[1,b,c;z], where b=m+n, c=m+1, z=b/(a+b) for fmn1(a,b,x) and c=n+1, z=a/(a+b) for fmn2(a,b,x), respectively. Due to the non−trivial structure of infinite series that are used to define them, the computation for hyper−geometric poses challenges. Convergence of their series strictly depends on the values of parameters. Computational issues such as cancellation or round−off error emerge. Solution method: This research introduces novel bi−directional hyper−radial functions that are used to establish fresh recurrence relationships for electron repulsion integrals, eliminating the dependence on hyper−geometric functions. Dual functionality is inherent in the hyper−radial functions as they offer alternative solutions for definite integrals involving higher transcendental functions. Additionally, they transform the representation of the hyper−geometric functions into finite power series. References: [1] J. Bezanson, A. Edelman, S. Karpinski, V.B.

Even while Shor's algorithm cannot yet be implemented on quantum computers, it indicates that asymmetric key encryption will not be practicable or secure in the near future. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has started looking for a post-quantum encryption algorithm that is resistant to the development of future quantum computers as a response to this security concern. The current focus is on standardizing asymmetric cryptography that should be impenetrable by a quantum computer. This has become increasingly important in recent years. Currently, the process of standardizing asymmetric cryptography is coming very close to being finished. This study evaluated the performance of two post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, both of which were selected as NIST fourth-round finalists. The research assessed the key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation operations, providing insights into their efficiency and suitability for real-world applications. Further research and standardization efforts are required to enable secure and efficient post-quantum encryption. When selecting appropriate post-quantum encryption algorithms for specific applications, factors such as security levels, performance requirements, key sizes, and platform compatibility should be taken into account. This paper provides helpful insight for post-quantum cryptography researchers and practitioners, assisting in the decision-making process for selecting appropriate algorithms to protect confidential data in the age of quantum computing.","asymmetric cryptography; BIKE; classic McEliece; cryptography; key encapsulation mechanism; post-quantum cryptography","Algorithms; Computer Security; Computers; Computing Methodologies; Quantum Theory; algorithm; computer analysis; computer security; quantum theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164248561"

Quantum walks are heading the development of quantum algorithms for searching information on graphs more efficiently than their classical counterparts. A quantum-walk-based algorithm standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The lackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search graph structures whose vertices have a self-loop of weight l. This paper addresses several issues related to applying the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids successfully. Firstly, we show that only one of the two stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. In the most discrepant case shown here, a stopping condition is prematurely satisfied at the step T=288 with a success probability Pr=0.593276, while the suitable condition captures the actual amplification that occurred until T=409 with Pr=0.878178. We also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on both the space density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. For instance, we show here that decreases in the density of solutions can even take a success probability of 0.849178 to 0.961896. In contrast, increases in the relative distances can even take a success probability of 0.871665 to 0.940301. Furthermore, this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal adjustment of the self-loop weight l for such d-dimensional grids. It turns out other fits of l found in the literature are particular cases. Our experiments demonstrate that successful searches for multiple solutions with higher than two dimensions are possible by achieving success probabilities such as 0.999979, with the value of l proposed here, where it would be 0.637346, with the value of l proposed in previous works. Finally, we observe a two-to-one relation between the steps of the lackadaisical quantum walk and Grover's algorithm, which requires modifications in the stopping condition. That modified stopping condition can escape intermediary fluctuations that would produce premature stops at T=6 with Pr=0.000878 where the system can evolve until T=354 with Pr=0.99999, as an example that we show here.

Harnessing the peculiarities of quantum computation for machine learning tasks offers promising advantages. Quantum-inspired machine learning has revealed how relevant benefits for machine learning problems can be obtained using the quantum information theory even without employing quantum computers. In the recent past, experiments have demonstrated how to design an algorithm for binary classification inspired by the method of quantum state discrimination, which exhibits high performance with respect to several standard classifiers. However, a generalization of this quantum-inspired binary classifier to a multi-class scenario remains nontrivial. Typically, a simple solution in machine learning decomposes multi-class classification into a combinatorial number of binary classifications, with a concomitant increase in computational resources. In this study, we introduce a quantum-inspired classifier that avoids this problem. Inspired by quantum state discrimination, our classifier performs multi-class classification directly without using binary classifiers. We first compared the performance of the quantum-inspired multi-class classifier with eleven standard classifiers. The comparison revealed an excellent performance of the quantum-inspired classifier. Comparing these results with those obtained using the decomposition in binary classifiers shows that our method improves the accuracy and reduces the time complexity. Therefore, the quantum-inspired machine learning algorithm proposed in this work is an effective and efficient framework for multi-class classification. Finally, although these advantages can be attained without employing any quantum component in the hardware, we discuss how it is possible to implement the model in quantum hardware. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-class classification; Quantum information; Quantum-inspired machine learning","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Computer hardware; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Binary classification; Binary classifiers; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Multi-class classification; Performance; Quantum Information; Quantum machines; Quantum state discrimination; Quantum-inspired machine learning; Machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145965749"

Two key elements must be minimized To maintain acceptable computational complexity in QML: the number of qubits required to encode classical data and the number of quantum gates. This paper proposes a novel angle encoding with learnable rotation to drastically reduce the qubits and circuit depth from O(N) to O(⌈log2(N)⌉) qubits, and only N parameterized gates, where N is the input size. Additionally, an extended quantum convolutional layer is introduced with multiple quantum circuits (quantum kernel) that allow for the configuration of any arbitrary size, stride, and dilation analogous to a classical convolutional layer. The proposed quantum convolutional layer learns multiple feature maps with a single quantum kernel while reducing computational cost by employing angle encoding with learnable rotation. Extensive experiments were performed by comparing diverse types of quantum convolutional configurations in a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) over a balanced subset of the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, achieving an accuracy of 0.90 and 0.7850, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Quantum angle encoding; Quantum–classical neural networks; Variational quantum circuits","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Encoding (symbols); Network coding; Timing circuits; Classical neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Encodings; Quantum angle; Quantum angle encoding; Quantum circuit; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Quantum–classical neural network; Variational quantum circuit; Qubits","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153088632"

Our method involves benchmarking a theoretical protocol to compute gas-phase quantities using DLPNO Coupled-Cluster calculations as reference, followed by estimating solvation contributions to the reaction Gibbs free energies using both explicit partial (micro)solvation steps for charged solutes and neutral coordination complexes, as well as a continuum solvation procedure for all solutes involved in the complexation process. We rationalized the stability of these doxorubicin-metal complexes by inspecting quantities obtained from the topology of their electron densities, particularly the bond critical points and non-covalent interaction index. Our approach allowed us to identify representative species in solution phase, infer the most likely complexation process for each case, and identify key intramolecular interactions involved in the stability of these compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting thermodynamic constants for the complexation of doxorubicin with transition metal ions. Unlike other methods, our procedure is computationally affordable for medium-sized systems and provides valuable insights even with limited experimental data. Furthermore, it can be extended to describe the complexation process between 3d-transition metal ions and other bioactive ligands. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Doxorubicin-transition metal complexes; Intramolecular interactions; Micro-solvation; Theoretical protocol benchmarking; Thermodynamic solvation cycle","Antineoplastic Agents; Coordination Complexes; Doxorubicin; Ions; Thermodynamics; Zinc; Coordination reactions; Gibbs free energy; Metal complexes; Metal ions; Numerical methods; Phase transitions; Quantum chemistry; Solvation; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; cupric ion; doxorubicin; transition element; zinc ion; antineoplastic agent; coordination compound; doxorubicin; ion; zinc; 3d transition metals; Complexation process; Doxorubicin; Doxorubicin-transition metal complex; Intramolecular interactions; Micro-solvation; Theoretical protocol benchmarking; Thermodynamic solvation cycle; Transition metal ions; Transition-metal complex; Article; benchmarking; chemical interaction; complex formation; covalent bond; electron; gas; molecular interaction; quantum chemistry; solvation; thermodynamics; chemistry; thermodynamics; Benchmarking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160442796"

This paper introduces RAVA, a true random number generator based on avalanche noise. RAVA is an open-source device designed to offer a transparent and customizable platform, making auditable and high-quality entropy accessible to a wider audience. The device employs a differential design, which involves comparing two similar noise sources to mitigate the impact of environmental factors. Furthermore, RAVA incorporates a dual entropy core architecture featuring two independent entropy channels that generate random bytes simultaneously. A stochastic model is theoretically derived and empirically confirmed, offering valuable insights into the entropy extraction mechanism and allowing the estimation of the minimum bias attainable. An implementation is presented as a discrete circuit with an ATmega32U4 microcontroller including a USB interface, achieving an unbiased throughput of 136.0 Kbit/s without the necessity of post-processing algorithms. The generated random bytes are evaluated for bias and serial correlation, their entropy is assessed using NIST SP 800-90B estimators, and the randomness quality is verified using the NIST 800-22R1a test suit.

Interestingly, multiphoton quantum systems can host many complex forms of interference and scattering processes that are essential to perform operations that are intractable on classical systems. Unfortunately, the quantum coherence properties of multiphoton systems degrade upon propagation leading to undesired quantum-to-classical transitions. Furthermore, the manipulation of multiphoton quantum systems requires nonlinear interactions at the few-photon level. Here, we introduce the quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem to describe the scattering and interference effects of propagating multiphoton systems. This fundamental theorem demonstrates that the quantum statistical fluctuations, can be modified upon propagation in the absence of conventional light-matter interactions. The generality of our formalism unveils the conditions under which the evolution of multiphoton systems can lead to surprising photon statistics modifications. Specifically, we show that the implementation of conditional measurements may enable the all-optical preparation of multiphoton systems with attenuated quantum statistics below the shot-noise limit. Remarkably, this effect cannot be explained through the classical theory of optical coherence. As such, our work opens new paradigms within the established field of quantum coherence. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Photons; Quantum optics; Statistical mechanics; Cittert-Zernike theorem; Multiphoton quantum; Multiphoton systems; Photonic systems; Quantum coherence; Quantum photonics; Quantum system; Quantum-state engineering; Recent progress; Van Cittert; Shot noise","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160200443"

Four objectives are modelled, two related to maintaining the crude oil processing level, and the other two aim to keep the refinery operations as smooth as possible. The proposed method, Constrained-Decomposition of Quantum-Inspired Grammar-based Linear Genetic Programming (C-DQIGLGP), uses Quantum-Inspired Grammar-based Linear Genetic Programming (QIGLGP), replacing its hierarchical approach for the objectives with a multi-objective decomposition-based one. To achieve this goal, QIGLGP was profoundly modified regarding sorting individuals, updating the population, and applying the evolutionary operator. Individuals whose objective values related to processing level are under a predefined limit are better ranked. We compare the results of C-DQIGLGP for five scenarios from a real refinery to those obtained by QIGLGP and Constrained Non-dominated Sort QIGLGP (C-NSQIGLGP), from literature, demonstrating the better performance of C-DQIGLGP for all cases. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","decomposition; evolutionary multi-objective optimization; genetic programming; quantum-inspired algorithm; refinery scheduling","C (programming language); Crude oil; Genetic programming; Multiobjective optimization; Refining; Scheduling algorithms; Crude oil scheduling; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Linear genetic programming; Multi objective; Multi objective algorithm; Oil refineries; Optimization method; Quantum-inspired algorithm; Refinery scheduling; Scheduling problem; Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168994476"

Pauli channels are ideal structures where qubits are transmitted or contained, commonly altering them with specific fingerprints. The ultimate limit imposed on such estimation is addressed using the quantum Fisher information, stating a lower bound for it. Although the most simple scheme suggests performing such an estimation directly using the individual channel, other approaches have shown improved outcomes by repeating identical copies of the channel for the characterization, or otherwise those connected inside of specific circuit arrangements. These connections commonly include path superposition or causal indefinite architectures. In addition, other improvements have been observed in concrete channels when complementary unitary controls are included. The current research analyses the complete set of Pauli channels under some of those architectures in a comparative approach to reach a better estimation, thus stating hierarchies. It is observed that the use of those unitary controls notably improves previous outcomes by several orders of magnitude. © 2023 by the author.","Pauli channels; quantum Fisher information; quantum parameter estimation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176129939"

Infection by the virus occurs through the interaction of viral S protein with the hosts’ angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. By leveraging resources such as the DrugBank database and bioinformatics techniques, ligands with potential activity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were designed and identified in this investigation. The FTMap server and the Molegro software were used to determine the active site of the Spike-ACE2 protein’s crystal structure. Virtual screening was performed using a pharmacophore model obtained from antiparasitic drugs, obtaining 2000 molecules from molport®. The ADME/Tox profiles were used to identify the most promising compounds with desirable drug characteristics. The binding affinity investigation was then conducted with selected candidates. A molecular docking study showed five structures with better binding affinity than hydroxychloroquine. Ligand_003 showed a binding affinity of −8.645 kcal·mol−1, which was considered an optimal value for the study. The values presented by ligand_033, ligand_013, ligand_044, and ligand_080 meet the profile of novel drugs. To choose compounds with favorable potential for synthesis, synthetic accessibility studies and similarity analyses were carried out. Molecular dynamics and theoretical IC50 values (ranging from 0.459 to 2.371 µM) demonstrate that these candidates are promising for further tests. Chemical descriptors showed that the candidates had strong molecule stability. Theoretical analyses here show that these molecules have potential as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and therefore warrant further investigation. © 2023 by the authors.","antiviral; COVID-19; molecular modeling; new drugs","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Antiviral Agents; COVID-19; Humans; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Binding; SARS-CoV-2; amodiaquine; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; chloroquine; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; hydroxychloroquine; ligand; mefloquine; mepacrine; piperaquine; primaquine; pyronaridine; quinidine; quinine; tafenoquine; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; protein binding; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; animal experiment; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; crystal structure; drug absorption; drug design; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug identification; drug metabolism; drug protein binding; drug screening; drug targeting; enzyme active site; female; human; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; IC50; male; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; molecular model; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; pharmacophore; process optimization; quantum chemistry; rat; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stereochemistry; structure activity relation; theoretical study; toxicity testing; water solubility; chemistry; coronavirus disease 2019","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160380812"

It is believed the hydroxysulfinyl radical is an intermediate species for the production of atmospheric sulfuric acid. Two stable configurations HOSO and HSO2 have been reported for such a radical in the gas phase. This work aims at studying these isomers in the aqueous medium. The electrical and reactivity quantities — electronic chemical potential (μ), chemical hardness (η), and electrophilicity (ϵ) — are here calculated and compared. Considering first solvation shells (15 H2O for HSO2 and 23 H2O for HOSO), an increase of 25% in the dipole moment of HSO2 was obtained, while the dipole moment of HOSO decreases in 11%. Both solvated isomers grow softer (η decreases) contrasted to the gas phase. Methods: HOSO and HSO2 are studied through a sequential Monte Carlo/quantum mechanics approach. Lennard–Jones plus the Coulomb potentials were used to represent intermolecular potential interaction in the frame of the DICE package.

The proposed novel high-performance scheme (RDFPM-PML-GPU) is mainly motived by the items below: (a) a reduced-dimensional finite pointset method (RDFPM) is first presented to solve the 2D/3D spatial derivatives in GPE, which has lower calculated amount than the traditional FPM (TFPM) for the derivatives; (b) the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique is adopted to treat the absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) which is used for the infinite exterior region, and the time-splitting technique is resorted to reduce the computing complexity in PML; (c) a fast parallel algorithm based on CUDA-program is proposed to accelerate the computation in the proposed meshless scheme with local matrix on two GPUs. The numerical convergent rate and advantages of the proposed meshless scheme are demonstrated by solving two examples, which include the comparisons between the proposed RDFPM and TFPM, the merit of easily implemented local refinement point distribution in meshless method, and the merit of PML-ABCs over the zero Dirichlet boundary treatment for unbounded domain. Meanwhile, the high efficiency of the proposed GPU-based parallelization algorithm is tested and discussed by simulating 3D examples, which shows that the speed-up rate is about 500-times of using two-GPUs over a single CPU. Finally, the proposed RDFPM-PML-GPU method is used to predict the long-time evolution of quantum vortex in 2D/3D GPEs describing Bose–Einstein condensates.

However, it is challenging to model their mechanics due to the presence of electromagnetic couplings. In this paper, a mathematical, physical, and computational framework is introduced, for a cation particle moving through an anion sub-lattice structure in the presence of two electromagnetic fields: an external electromagnetic field; and a self-induced electromagnetic field coming from back-reaction phenomena caused by the relative movement of cations with respect to the mentioned structure. Our approach seeks to incorporate magnetic effects, such as magnetic induction and spin of cations, which are not incorporated in other models, mainly due to the intrinsic difficulty of 3D effects. We propose a quantum mechanical formalism based on a Schrödinger-type equation, where a wave function models the behavior of a cation in presence of an external electromagnetic potential, coupled with transient and self-induced electromagnetic effects. To solve the model, a space–time coupled numerical scheme is presented, which allows the possibility of time-evolving electromagnetic effects. The technique uses finite-elements in space and time-marching schemes in time. While a time-explicit marching scheme is used to update the magnetic and electric-potential fields, a time-implicit marching scheme is used to solve the coupled Schrödinger equation. This strategy allows us to update the electromagnetic contributions and wave functions at each time-step.

Therefore, a symmetric cryptosystem that encrypts images and resists known attacks is developed. Subsequently, in this work, an encryption algorithm known as Image Cipher utilizing Lorenz equation and a Bijective Function—ICLEBF are proposed. In the proposal, the Lorenz equations and the Bijective function are used to generate boxes, the permutation, and schedule keys, considering that all these elements are different in each encryption process. The encryption procedure consists of 14 rounds, where a different box is applied in each round. In this type of algorithm, the impact of quantum computers will be less forceful and can be useful for that epoch. On the other hand, the quality of the encrypted images and the loss of sharpness in decoded images with damage are measured. In addition, an attack from five types of noise (one of which is a developed proposal) is carried out by applying it to encrypted images. Finally, the results of the proposed ICLEBF are compared with other recent image encryption algorithms, including the Advanced Encryption Standard. As a result, this proposal resists known attacks and others that the current standard does not support. © 2023 by the authors.","bijective function; dynamic permutation; dynamic S-box; Lorenz equations; noise in encrypted images","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147870617"

In this research, the authors explored the application of variational quantum circuits to predicting hypocalcemia risk following thyroid surgery. Hypocalcemia, resulting from hypoparathyroidism, is a common post-surgical complication. This novel approach includes a topology grid search of the variational quantum circuits. To execute the grid search, our research employed a classical optimiser that guided the adjustment of different circuit topologies, assessing their impact on predictive performance. Our research used, as relevant features, an intra-operative PTH (parathyroid hormone) at 10 min post-removal and percentage decrease of pre-operative and intra-operative PTH levels.

Nevertheless, when the adjacency matrix of a graph can be decomposed into a sum of permutation matrices, we can always build a shift operator for a quantum walk that has a block diagonal matrix representation. In this paper, we analyze the mapping process of block diagonal operators into quantum circuit form and apply this method to obtain quantum circuits that generate quantum walks on the most common topologies found in the literature: the straight line, the cyclic graph, the hypercube and the complete graph. The obtained circuits are then executed on quantum processors of the type Falcon r5.11 L and Falcon r4T (two of each type) through IBM Quantum Composer platform and on the Qiskit Aer simulator, performing three steps for each topology. The resulting distributions were compared against analytical distributions, using the statistical distance ℓ1 as a performance metric. Regarding experimental executions, we obtained short ℓ1 distances in the cases of quantum circuits with a low amount of multi-control gates, being the quantum processors of the type Falcon r4T the ones that provided more accurate results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Block diagonal unitary matrix; IBM quantum; Multi-controlled quantum gates; Quantum circuits; Quantum walks; Shunt decomposition","Electric network analysis; Graph theory; Matrix algebra; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Block diagonal; Block diagonal unitary matrix; Evolution operator; IBM quantum; Multi-controled quantum gate; Quantum circuit; Quantum gates; Quantum walk; Shunt decomposition; Unitary matrix; Mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150484711"

The main treatment for neonatal jaundice is phototherapy with blue light, which is still widely studied because the photophysical processes involved are not fully understood. Methods: Calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) at M062X/6-31G(d,p) level were performed in order to evaluate the structural, electronic, and topological properties of bilirubin isomers. It was found that the ZZ conformation can form a greater number of hydrogen bonds, which gives the isomer greater energy stabilization compared to the other ZE, EZ, and EE isomers, and that the EE isomer is the conformer with the lowest energy of stabilization. The hydrogen bonds were characterized by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and for the ZZ isomer four hydrogen bonds (HBs) were found classified as intermediate, ∇2 ρ(r) > 0, H(r) > 0.

One of the most interesting is medical image analysis. Applying semantic segmentation techniques in that field has great potential to assist physicians in diagnosing and analysing medical scans for the patient's benefit. Traditionally, several techniques have been applied in order to perform semantic segmentation. However, with the development of Deep Learning methods, there was a paradigm shift. Deep learning techniques are able to achieve great results, comparable to human-level performance. In order to achieve state-of-the-art results, researchers have to lean on the task of designing novel deep neural network architectures. That process is very time-consuming and heavily relies on experience and expert knowledge. Neural architecture search is the process of automatising the search for new deep neural network architectures. Quantum-Inspired Neural Architecture Search is a neural architecture search algorithm that leverages the benefits of quantum-inspired computing to search for neural network architectures efficiently. In this work, we adapt this to search for semantic segmentation neural networks and apply it to medical image analysis.

These biological subsystems exhibit quantum features which possibly are responsible for their high efficiency; the latter may comprise multipartite entanglement and the apparent tunnelling of the initial quantum state. At first, to study these aspects, a multidisciplinary approach including experimental biology, spectroscopy, physics, and math modelling is required. Then, a global computer modelling analysis is achieved in the computational biology domain. The current work implements the Hierarchical Equations of Motion to numerically solve the open quantum system problem regarding this complex. The time-evolved states obtained with this method are then analysed under several measures of entanglement, some of them already proposed in the literature. However, for the first time, the maximum overlap with respect to the closest separable state is employed. This authentic multipartite entanglement measure provides information on the correlations, not only based on the system bipartitions as in the usual analysis. Our study has led us to note a different view of FMO multipartite entanglement as tiny contributions to the global entanglement suggested by other more basic measurements. Additionally, in another related trend, the initial state, considered as a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, is tracked using a novel approach, considering how it could be followed under the fidelity measure on all possible permutations of the FMO subsystems through its dynamical evolution by observing the tunnelling in the most probable locations. Both analyses demanded significant computational work, making for a clear example of the complexity required in computational biology. © 2023 by the authors.","Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex; light-harvesting complexes; quantum coherence; quantum entanglement; quantum open systems; quantum state transfer","Bacterial Proteins; Chlorobi; Computer Simulation; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Quantum Theory; bacterial protein; article; bioinformatics; computer model; energy transfer; light harvesting system; motion; simulation; transference; chemistry; Chlorobi; computer simulation; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; light harvesting system; metabolism; quantum theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164846666"

In this paper, we investigate the completion of a nonadiabatic evolution into a shortcut to adiabaticity for a quantum field confined within a one-dimensional cavity containing two movable mirrors. Expanding upon our prior research, we characterize the field’s state using two Moore functions that enables us to apply reverse engineering techniques in constructing the STA. Regardless of the initial evolution, we achieve a smooth extension of the Moore functions that implements the STA. This extension facilitates the computation of the mirrors’ trajectories based on the aforementioned functions.

Despite the existence of diverse antineoplastic treatments, these do not possess the expected efficacy in many cases. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor processes allows the identification of a greater number of therapeutic targets employed in the study of new anticancer drugs. In the last decades, peptide-based therapy design using computational chemistry has gained importance in the field of oncology therapeutics. This work aims to evaluate the electronic structure, physicochemical properties, stability, and inhibition of ETFS amino acids and peptides derived from the p53-MDM2 binding domain with action in cancer cells; by means of chemical descriptors at the DFT-BHandHLYP level in an aqueous solution, and its intermolecular interactions through molecular docking studies. The results show that The ETFS fragment plays a critical role in the intermolecular interactions. Thus, the amino acids E17, T18 and S20 increase intermolecular interactions through hydrogen bonds and enhance structural stability. F19, W23 and V25 enhance the formation of the alpha-helix. The hydrogen bonds formed by the backbone atoms for PNC-27, PNC-27-B and PNC-28 stabilize the α-helices more than hydrogen bonds formed by the side chains atoms. Also, molecular docking indicated that the PNC27B-MDM2, PNC28B-MDM2, PNC27-MDM2 and PNC28A-MDM2 complexes show the best binding energy. Therefore, DFT and molecular docking studies showed that the proposed peptides: PNC-28B, PNC-27B and PNC-28A could inhibit the binding of MDM2 to the p53 protein, decreasing the translocation and degradation of p53 native protein. © 2023","Anticancer peptides; Cancer; DFT-BHandHLYP study; Electronic structure; p53-MDM2","Amino Acids; Density Functional Theory; Molecular Docking Simulation; Peptides; Protein Binding; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Amino acids; Binding energy; Cancer cells; Chemical stability; Complexation; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Diseases; Electronic structure; Ionic strength; Molecular modeling; Peptides; Physicochemical properties; amino acid; mouse double minute 2 homolog; peptide derivative; pnc 27b peptide; pnc 28a peptide; pnc 28b peptide; protein p53; unclassified drug; amino acid; mouse double minute 2 homolog; peptide; protein binding; protein p53; Amino-acids; Anticancer peptide; Cancer; Density-functional-theory; DFT-BHandHLYP study; Docking studies; Electronic.structure; Intermolecular interactions; Molecular docking; P53-MDM2; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; aqueous solution; Article; binding site; cancer cell; carboxy terminal sequence; cheminformatics; complex formation; density functional theory; electrophilicity; hydrogen bond; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nucleophilicity; physical chemistry; protein domain; protein stability; quantum chemistry; static electricity; transactivation; chemistry; density functional theory; metabolism; molecular docking; Hydrogen bonds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152924737"

Specifically, we considered a single cavity mode coupled to auxiliary qubits described by the Tavis–Cummings model. As a figure of merit, we define the dynamical non-Markovianity as the tendency of a system to return to its initial state, instead of evolving monotonically to its steady state. We studied how this dynamical non-Markovianity can be manipulated in terms of the qubit frequency. We found that the control of the auxiliary systems affects the cavity dynamics as an effective time-dependent decay rate. Finally, we show how this tunable time-dependent decay rate can be tuned to engineer bosonic quantum memristors, involving memory effects that are fundamental for developing neuromorphic quantum technologies. © 2023 by the authors.","non-Markovanity; open quantum system; quantum memristor","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160571599"

Also, the quantum rounding operator exploits the features of the S-Transform to avoid nonlinearities. Complete quantum circuits for addition, subtraction, and halving operations were developed.

TNBC is distinguished by the lack of immunohistochemical expression of HER2, progesterone receptors, or oestrogen receptors. Although it has been reported that upregulation of EGFR and VEGFR-2 is associated with TNBC progression, no proven effective targeted therapy exists at this time. We used structural bioinformatics methods, including density functional theory, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness models, to identify promising EGFR/VEGFR-2 inhibitors from N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-[4-(3-oxo-3-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl) phenoxy] acetamide and six of its modified derivatives in light of the lack of effective targets inhibitor Version 14 of Spartan software was used to analyse density functional theory. The Schrodinger software suite 2018’s Maestro interface was used for the molecular docking analysis, and the admetSAR and swissADME servers were used for drug-likeness and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity. All of the compounds showed strong electronic characteristics. Additionally, all of the tested compounds met the ADMET and drug-likeness requirements without a single instance of Lipinski’s rule of five violations. Additionally, the molecules’ levels of affinity for the target proteins varied. The highest binding affinities were demonstrated by the MOLb-VEGFR-2 complex (− 9.925 kcal/mol) and the MOLg-EGFR complex (− 5.032 kcal/mol). The interaction of the molecules in the domain of the EGFR and VEGFR-2 receptors was also better understood through molecular dynamic simulation of the complex. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Breast cancer; Density functional theory; Drug-likeness; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamic simulation; Pharmacokinetics; Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)","Acetamides; ErbB Receptors; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2; acetamide derivative; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; n (4 methoxyphenyl) 2 [4 (3 oxo 3 phenylprop 1 en 1 yl) phenoxy]acetamide; unclassified drug; vandetanib; vasculotropin inhibitor; vasculotropin receptor 2; acetamide derivative; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; vasculotropin receptor 2; Article; binding affinity; cancer therapy; computer model; controlled study; density functional theory; drug absorption; drug binding; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug metabolism; drug screening; drug solubility; drug structure; electrophilicity; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; nucleophilicity; protein expression; structural bioinformatics; structure activity relation; surface area; triple negative breast cancer; water solubility; chemistry; human; metabolism; triple negative breast cancer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153994455"

Thus, this work discusses about the extraction procedure of 1-nitro-2-phenylethane (1N2PE) from Aniba canelilla, its biotransformation setup into 2-phenylethanol (2PE) using four fungi, Lasiodiplodia caatinguensis (phytopathogenic fungus from Citrus sinensis), Colletotrichum sp. (phytopathogenic fungus from Euterpe oleracea), Aspergillus flavus and Rigidoporus lineatus isolated from copper mining waste located in the interior of the Brazilian Amazon. A detailed experimental and theoretical vibrational analysis (IR and Raman) have allowed us to perform some charge transfer effects on the title compounds (push-pull effect) by monitoring specific vibrational modes of their electrophilic and nucleophilic molecular sites. The solvent interactions promote molecular conformations that affect the vibrational spectra of the donor and acceptor groups, as can be seen comparatively in the gas and aqueous solution spectra, an effect possibly related to the bathochromic shift in the calculated optical spectrum of the compounds. The nonlinear optical behavior shows that while the solvent reduces the response of 1N2PE, the response of 2PE increases the optical parameters, which presents low refractive index (n) and first hyperpolarizability. (β) is almost eight times that reported for urea (42.79 a.u.), a common nonlinear optical material. Furthermore, the bioconversion goes from an electrophilic to a nucleophilic compound, affecting its molecular reactivity. Methods: 1N2PE was obtained from Aniba canelilla, whose essential oil is constituted of ∼ 80 % of 2PE. The A. canelilla essential oil was extracted under hydrodistillation. The biotransformation reactions were performed in autoclaved liquid media (100 mL) composed of malt extract (2%) in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Each culture was incubated in an orbital shaker (130 rpm) at 32 ∘ C during 7 days and after that, 50 mg of 1N2PE (80%) were diluted in 100 μ L of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the reactions flasks. Aliquots (2 mL) were removed using ethyl acetate (2 mL) and analyzed by GC-MS (fused silica capillary col1umn, Rtx -5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μ m) in order to determine the amount of 1N2PE biotransformation. FTIR 1N2PE and 2PE spectra were obtained by attenuated total reflectance (ATR), using a Agilent CARY 630 spectrometer, in the spectral region 4000-650 cm - 1 . The quantum chemical calculations were carried out in the Gaussian 09 program while the DICE code was used to perform the classical Monte Carlo simulations and generate the liquid environment using the classical All-Atom Optimized parameters for Liquid Simulations (AA-OPLS). All nonlinear optical properties, reactive parameters, and electronic excitations were calculated using the Density Functional Theory framework coupled to the standard 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","DFT; NLO; Reactivity descriptors; Solvent effects; Spectroscopic characterization","Fungi; Oils, Volatile; Phenylethyl Alcohol; Quantum Theory; Solvents; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Thermodynamics; 1 nitro 2 phenylethane; acetic acid ethyl ester; dimethyl sulfoxide; natural product; nucleophile; phenethyl alcohol; solvent; unclassified drug; 1-nitro-2-phenylethane; essential oil; aqueous solution; Article; Aspergillus flavus; biome; biotransformation; calculation; chemical reaction; chromatophore; conformation; controlled study; density functional theory; electrophilicity; Euterpe oleracea; gas chromatography; geometry; hydrodistillation; hydrogen bond; Lasiodiplodia; molecular model; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; nucleophilicity; quantum mechanics; refraction index; spectroscopy; sweet orange; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; fungus; quantum theory; Raman spectrometry; thermodynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163969625"

Computational simulation based on quantum mechanics theory by solving Schrödinger Equation for n-body problem may allow the theoretical calculation of drug geometry, charge distribution and dipole moment, electronic levels and molecular orbitals, electronic transitions, and vibrational transitions. Additionally, the development of novel nanotechnology-based delivery systems containing TAC can be an approach for reducing the dose applied topically, increasing dermal retention, and reducing the reported side effects due to the controlled release pattern. Firstly, this paper was devoted to obtaining the molecular, electronic, and vibrational data for TAC by using five semi-empirical (SE) methods and one Density Functional Theory (DFT) method in order to expand the knowledge about the drug properties by computational simulation. Then, this study was carried out to prepare TAC-loaded poly(ԑ-caprolactone) nanocapsules by interfacial polymer deposition following solvent displacement and investigate the in vitro drug permeation using the Franz diffusion cell and the photoacoustic spectroscopy. Computational simulations were compared in the three schemes SE/SE, SE/DFT, and DFT/DFT, where the first method represented the procedure used for geometry optimization and the second one was performed to extract electronic and vibrational properties. Computational data showed correspondence with TAC geometry description and electronic properties, with few differences in HOMO – LUMO gap (Δ) and dipole values. The SE/DFT and DFT/DFT methods presented a better drug description for the UV–Vis, Infrared, and Raman spectra with low deviation from experimental values. Franz cell model demonstrated that TAC was more delivered across the Strat-M® membrane from the solution than the drug-loaded poly(ԑ-caprolactone) nanocapsules. Photoacoustic spectroscopy assay revealed that these nanocapsules remained more retained into the Strat-M® membranes, which is desirable for the topical application. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Franz diffusion cell; Macrolide lactone; Nanotechnology; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Semiempirical and DFT methods; Skin-related autoimmune disorders","Computation theory; Control theory; Controlled drug delivery; Electronic properties; Molecular orbitals; Nanocapsules; Quantum theory; Targeted drug delivery; nanocapsule; polycaprolactone; polymer; propylene glycol; solvent; tacrolimus; Autoimmune disorder; Density functional theory methods; Density-functional-theory; Franz diffusion cells; Macrolide lactone; Macrolides; Semi-empirical; Semiempirical and density functional theory method; Skin-related autoimmune disorder; Tacrolimus; Article; autoimmune disease; chemical structure; computer simulation; controlled drug release; controlled study; density functional theory; dermal retention; dipole; drug delivery system; drug retention; geometry; in vitro study; molecular biology; nanotechnology; photoacoustic spectroscopy; process optimization; quantum theory; Raman spectrometry; side effect; skin; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Density functional theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171461918"

Generic characterizations of such quantum processes, however, can be very resource-intensive, and many tools have been developed for identifying particular aspects of a quantum computer. In this article, we verify whether a tool called Swap Test can be used in order to identify decoherence in an implementation-agnostic way. Simulations and experimental results show that a modified version of a Toffoli Swap Test can be employed as an alternative to a full quantum process tomography, consuming considerably less computational resources as a consequence. Moreover, it is also shown to be able to simulate in a generic quantum computer a quantum optical communication link that employs two-photon interference. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Quantum computing; Quantum decoherence; Quantum process; Swap Test","Quantum communication; Qubits; Computational resources; Decoherence; Fault-tolerant; Processes stemming; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum decoherence; Quantum process; Quantum process tomography; Swap test; Optical communication","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159966296"

Since it was apparent that large-scale quantum computers can comfortably break most commonly used cryptographic protocols, proposals of quantum-safe KEX began to appear. Some of these proposals combine well-known classical cryptographic key exchange protocols with novel post-quantum schemes. The main rationale behind this hybrid structure is to retain the time-tested trust on “pre-quantum KEXs” while facilitating a smoother transition toward a post-quantum world. In this paper we present a systematic mapping study of post-quantum hybrid KEXs, given insights into their characteristics, terminology, efficiency, security and open design challenges. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid KEX classification taking into account several relevant design considerations associated to these schemes. Our systematic mapping shows that primary research in this subject strongly suggests that hybrid KEXs achieve an acceptable performance for a number of important applications, and that they can fit into widely used network protocols. These features indicate that hybrid KEX will shortly become an important building block for secure network communications, even in a worst-case scenario where large-scale quantum computers are prevalent. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Hybrid key exchange; Post-quantum cryptography; Systematic mapping study","Mapping; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; Cryptographic key exchanges; Cryptographic protocols; Hybrid key exchange; Hybrid structure; Key exchange protocols; Key-exchange; Large scale quantum computers; Post quantum; Post quantum cryptography; Systematic mapping studies; Network protocols","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128079569"

For chemical reactions in complex environments, the combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with a molecular mechanics (MM) representation is usually necessary in a hybrid QM/MM framework. However, even within the QM/MM approximation, the affordable sampling of the phase space is, in general, quite restricted. To reduce drastically the computational cost of the simulations, several methods such as umbrella sampling require performing a priori a selection of a reaction coordinate. The quality of the computed results, in an affordable computational time, is intimately related to the reaction coordinate election which is, in general, a nontrivial task. In this work, we provide an approach to model reactive processes in complex environments that does not require the a priori selection of a reaction coordinate. The proposed methodology combines QM/MM simulations with an extrapolation of the nudged elastic bands (NEB) method to the free energy surface (FENEB). We present and apply our own FENEB scheme to optimize MFEP in different reactive processes, using QM/MM frameworks at semiempirical and density functional theory levels. Our implementation is based on performing the FENEB optimization by uncoupling the optimization of the band in a perpendicular and tangential direction. In each step, a full optimization with the spring force is performed, which guarantees that the images remain evenly distributed. The robustness of the method and the influence of sampling on the quality of the optimized MFEP and its associated free energy barrier are studied. We show that the FENEB method provides a good estimation of the reaction barrier even with relatively short simulation times, supporting that its combination with QM/MM frameworks provides an adequate tool to study chemical processes in complex environments. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","","article; chemical reaction; density functional theory; election; molecular mechanics; quantum mechanics; simulation; spring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171804183"

As the adsorption of Methylene Blue into GO is related to a graphene derivative’s oxidation degree (OD), we combined adsorption experimental information and theoretical data to estimate the hydroxyl/epoxy ratio. The theoretical data were compared to the experimental adsorption of Methylene Blue and Indigo Carmine into GO synthesized in our department. Our results show GO systems with hydroxyl/epoxy ratios equal to 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 are the most representative in which the most coherent model corresponds to OH/EP=0.8 for our GO previously synthesized. Methods: The GO-MODEL software was developed in the present work to obtain cartesian coordinates of GO systems. We investigated 204 systems comprising models with 486 carbon atoms with the GFN2-xTB semiempirical quantum method. The supramolecular arrangements were constructed with the recently developed UD-APARM program.

However, in the current decade, novel computer-science concepts were rapidly extended to the fields of quantum processing, computation, and communication. Thus, areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks have their quantum versions; furthermore, the quantum brain properties of learning, analyzing, and gaining knowledge are discussed. Quantum properties of matter conglomerates have been superficially explored in such terrain; however, the settlement of organized quantum systems able to perform processing can open a new pathway in the aforementioned domains. In fact, quantum processing involves certain requisites as the settlement of copies of input information to perform differentiated processing developed far away or in situ to diversify the information stored there. Both tasks at the end provide a database of outcomes with which to perform either information matching or final global processing with at least a subset of those outcomes. When the number of processing operations and input information copies is large, parallel processing (a natural feature in quantum computation due to the superposition) becomes the most convenient approach to accelerate the database settlement of outcomes, thus affording a time advantage. In the current study, we explored certain quantum features to realize a speed-up model for the entire task of processing based on a common information input to be processed, diversified, and finally summarized to gain knowledge, either in pattern matching or global information availability. By using superposition and non-local properties, the most valuable features of quantum systems, we realized parallel local processing to set a large database of outcomes and subsequently used post-selection to perform an ending global processing or a matching of information incoming from outside. We finally analyzed the details of the entire procedure, including its affordability and performance. The quantum circuit implementation, along with tentative applications, were also discussed. Such a model could be operated between large processing technological systems using communication procedures and also on a moderately controlled quantum matter conglomerate. Certain interesting technical aspects involving the non-local control of processing via entanglement were also analyzed in detail as an associated but notable premise. © 2023 by the authors.","Grover algorithm; non-local control; parallel processing; quantum databases; quantum intelligence; quantum multiple teleportation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148959391"

It also contributes to generate acid rain, which affects the ecosystems. To reduce its negative effects, new strategies to control the emissions are required. New and engineered materials are investigated to detect, capture, and eradicate toxic gases from the environment. Zinc oxide is considered a promising candidate. Here, we investigate the Cu-decorated ZnO(0001) surfaces as a single-atom catalyst (SAC) to reduce SO2 by first-principles calculations. We propose a two-step reduction mechanism. First, one of the S–O bonds is broken on the pristine surface, with a calculated activation energy of 14.76 kcal/mol, 1.84 kcal/mol larger than the one obtained in the Cu SAC. In the second step, the SO reduction is viable only for Cu SAC, with calculated activation energy of 29.28 kcal/mol. Our results point that Cu SAC improves the SO2 reduction, pointing it as a potentially efficient device to eradicate such harmful pollutant from the environment. Methods: The calculations were performed using the density functional theory, as implemented in quantum ESPRESSO package. The exchange–correlation energy was calculated within the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parameterization. Van der Waals dispersion-corrected interactions were considered. Spin-polarization was considered for studying dangling bonds in transition states. The minimum energy pathways were calculated by using the climbing image nudged elastic band. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adsorption; Cu SAC; SO<sub>2</sub> reduction; ZnO","copper; oxygen; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; zinc oxide; ab initio calculation; adsorption; Article; catalysis; catalyst; controlled study; covalent bond; crystal structure; density functional theory; dispersion; energy; polarization; reaction analysis; surface property","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148412024"

Graphene is a potential candidate to be used as TCO due to its optical and electrical properties. Here, the effect of graphene as TCO is numerically analyzed by varying the number of graphene layers from one to ten. First, the optical properties are calculated based on the transmittance data, and then the HJT cell’s performance is simulated under the AM1.5 standard spectrum and the mean Atacama Desert solar spectral irradiance in Chile. In the modeling, the most relevant properties are calculated with the spectrum of the Atacama Desert. The most relevant values were obtained as follows: open circuit voltage (Formula presented.), short circuit current (Formula presented.), fill factor (Formula presented.), and energy conversion efficiency (Formula presented.). The maximum power of solar panels irradiated with the Atacama Desert spectrum exceeds the results obtained with the AM1.5 standard spectrum by (Formula presented.). When graphene is the transparent conducting oxide, quantum efficiency has a higher value in the ultraviolet range, which shows that it may be convenient to use graphene-based solar cells in places where ultraviolet intensity is high. © 2023 by the authors.","AFORS-HET; Atacama Desert; graphene; HIT solar cell; solar spectral irradiance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169104396"

It is thus natural to move beyond Bell's paradigmatic scenario and consider different causal structures. For the specific case of three observable variables, it is known that there are three nontrivial causal networks. Two of those are known to give rise to quantum nonclassicality: the instrumental and the triangle scenarios. Here we analyze the third and remaining one, which we name the Evans scenario, akin to the causal structure underlying the entanglement-swapping experiment. We prove a number of results about this elusive scenario and introduce new and efficient computational tools for its analysis that can also be adapted to deal with more general causal structures. We do not solve its main open problem - whether quantum nonclassical correlations can arise from it - but give a significant step in this direction by proving that postquantum correlations, analogous to the paradigmatic Popescu-Rohrlich box, do violate the constraints imposed by a classical description of the Evans causal structure.  © 2023 authors.

Prior to that, it took the insight of an educator and eminent computer scientist (Umesh Vazirani) to realize that a complete and consistent introduction to QM can be given via the language of qubits and quantum gates. Closer to the present, it took the profound intuition of another polymath (Terry Rudolph) to realize that the linear algebra normally at the foundation of such an approach can be replaced with a simple rewriting system accessible to middle school students. Rewriting systems are at the foundation of Computer Science, they are, in fact, the very fabric of it (e.g., Turing machines and lambda calculus), so these are very fortunate developments. Furthermore, a linear algebra prerequisite is now shared firmly in the CS undergraduate curriculum with Machine Learning, a topic that has known a very deep and sudden revival. Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) is inherently interdisciplinary and spans physics, computer science, mathematics, engineering, chemistry and materials science.

These designs aim at enabling quantum-safe cryptography solutions for constrained platforms by offloading the cost of bulk arithmetic from the main processor. One of the proposed architectures has area reduction as the main implementation goal; the second design improves the former on the energy footprint. This software-hardware co-design addresses the challenges of performing bulk arithmetic in software and reducing the control complexity in hardware, thus minimizing the communication overheads found on simple arithmetic accelerators. Compared to other designs in the literature, the proposed architectures do not rely on in-fabric memory and processing units, a key point for porting such solutions to any implementation technology such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).  © 2009-2012 IEEE.","Coprocessor; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); hardware/software co-design; low area; low energy; supersingular isogeny key encapsulation (SIKE); VHDL","Coprocessor; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware security; Hardware-software codesign; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Signal processing; Arithmetic; Co-processors; Complexity theory; Coprocessor.; Field programmable gate array; Field programmables; Hardware/software codesign; Low area; Lower energies; Programmable gate array; Public keys; Register; Signal processing algorithms; Supersingular isogeny key-encapsulation; Table lookup","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132516534"

Unlike software-based quantum computation simulators, which run on standard general-purpose computers and suffer from reduced performance, this hardware design, which is based on classical concepts of bits, registers and memories, aims to leverage pure parallelism and pipelined execution for efficient quantum computations via emulation. The architecture includes several key components: memories, computation unit, measurement unit and control unit. The quantum state memory stores the individual and group states of qubits. This memory is crucial for maintaining the quantum information required for quantum operations. Basic operators are stored in dedicated operator memory. Additionally, a scratch memory allows for larger operators to be dynamically built at runtime. The computation unit is responsible for performing complex number multiplications, which form the basis of tensor and matrix products necessary for executing quantum operations. A measurement unit enables quantum state sampling, which is an essential aspect of quantum computation. Furthermore, a control unit is incorporated to ensure the correct operation of the quantum processor’s data path. It utilizes a microprogram to manage and coordinate the functional units. All the functional units communicate with each other through dedicated and shared data buses, depending on the frequency of information exchange. This enables efficient data transfer and coordination among the components. The proposed hardware design has been simulated and proved to be effective in executing quantum operations. By exploiting parallelism and employing a pipelined execution, this architecture overcomes the limitations of software-based simulators, delivering improved performance for emulating quantum algorithms. We use Grover’s search algorithm as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the proposed hardware design and compare it to software-based simulation and to hardware-based algorithm-dedicated emulation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Data transfer; General purpose computers; Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Pipeline processing systems; Quantum optics; Qubits; Supercomputers; Classical logic; Control unit; Dedicated hardware; Functional units; Hardware design; Performance; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum operations; Quantum state; Benchmarking","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175535559"

Using VQCs, we find an optimal sequence of qubit-environment interactions that yield accurate estimations of the degree of non-Markovianity for the amplitude damping, phase damping, and the combination of both models.

Across a variety of new features, NEXMD v2.0 incorporates new implementations of two hybrid quantum-classical dynamics methods, namely, Ehrenfest dynamics (EHR) and the Ab-Initio Multiple Cloning sampling technique for Multiconfigurational Ehrenfest quantum dynamics (MCE-AIMC or simply AIMC), which are alternative options to the previously implemented trajectory surface hopping (TSH) method. To illustrate these methodologies, we outline a direct comparison of these three hybrid quantum-classical dynamics methods as implemented in the same NEXMD framework, discussing their weaknesses and strengths, using the modeled photodynamics of a polyphenylene ethylene dendrimer building block as a representative example. We also describe the expanded normal-mode analysis and constraints for both the ground and excited states, newly implemented in the NEXMD v2.0 framework, which allow for a deeper analysis of the main vibrational motions involved in vibronic dynamics. Overall, NEXMD v2.0 expands the range of applications of NEXMD to a larger variety of multichromophore organic molecules and photophysical processes involving quantum coherences and persistent couplings between electronic excited states and nuclear velocity. © 2023 American Chemical Society","","article; molecular dynamics; motion; software","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167776877"

In the last decades, great progress has been made in this field by developing quantum walk-based algorithms that can outperform classical ones. However, current quantum computers work based on the quantum circuit model of computation, and the general mapping from one model to the other is still an open problem. In this work, we provide a matrix analysis of the unitary evolution operator of UCDTQW, which is composed at a time of a shift and a coin operators. We conceive the shift operator of the system as the unitary matrix form of the adjacency matrix associated with the graph on which the UCDTQW takes place, and provide a set of equations to transform the latter into the former and vice versa. However, this mapping modifies the structure of the original graph into a directed multigraph, by splitting single edges and arcs of the original graph into multiple arcs. Thus, the fact that any unitary operator has a quantum circuit representation means that any adjacency matrix that complies with the transformation equations will be automatically associated with a quantum circuit, and any quantum circuit acting on a bipartite system will be always associated with a directed multigraph. Finally, we extend the definition of the coin operator to a superposition of coins in such a way that each coin acts on different vertices of the directed multigraph on which the UCDTQW takes place, and provide a description of how this can be implemented in circuit form. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Kraus operators; Multigraphs; Quantum circuits; Quantum walks","Computation theory; Directed graphs; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Adjacency matrix; Discrete time; Kraus operators; Model of computation; Multigraphs; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum walk; Time quantum; Universal model; Mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161917641"

This problem belongs to the NP-hard class of computational complexity and generalizes the well-known quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which is able to model a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems and also has applications in quantum computing. Several state-of-the-art methods in the literature for solving specific classes of PBO problems rely on the ability to quickly evaluate changes in objective function value upon a flip move, i.e., after changing the value of a Boolean variable in a given solution from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. In this work, we propose closed-form formulae, and develop algorithms and auxiliary data structures for quickly evaluating 1-flip move neighborhoods in PBO problems. We work with the objective function represented as a posiform, i.e., a sum of terms that may contain Boolean variables or negations thereof. This representation is interesting for solving large-scale instances, since converting a posiform to an expression containing no variable negations may take exponential time and space in the number of variables. We also provide implementations of our algorithms and data structures as a library written in C programming language. This library can be used to implement methods with fast flip move evaluations for solving PBO problem instances. We conducted computational experiments with implementations of a Iterated Tabu Search (ITS) metaheuristic, when solving randomly-generated instances, and also instances of the Hypergraph Maximum Cut problem, which can be easily recast as a PBO problem. The results showed that our best evaluation algorithms provided relatively large speedups as instance sizes increased, and became more competitive as a consequence of speedup. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Computational efficiency; Data structures; Fast flip moves; Heuristics; Pseudo-Boolean optimization","Boolean functions; C (programming language); Combinatorial optimization; Data structures; Function evaluation; Quantum computers; Tabu search; Binary optimization; Boolean variables; Combinatorial optimization problems; Fast flip move; Heuristic; Large-scales; Neighbourhood; NP-hard class; Optimization problems; Pseudo-Boolean optimization; Computational efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162749555"

There has been no transition from the laboratory use of quantum computers to more widespread use of the technology. As a result, quantum simulation has emerged as the accepted norm for supporting the validation of quantum algorithms. Many conventional algorithms benefit from grover's quantum search method because it accelerates their usage of search heuristics. For better multi-core load balancing, memory utilization, and simulation efficiency, this research presented a high-performance grover method simulation that combines the benefits of grover's technique with the parallel of cloud computing. This study also suggests and experimentally compares five distinct cloud-based computing architectures that are well-suited to quantum simulation. Through research and testing, this study also verifies the optimization's efficiency.

Cruzain, the main cysteine protease of T. cruzi, is a validated target for developing drug candidates for Chagas disease. Thiosemicarbazones are one of the most relevant warheads used in covalent inhibitors targeting cruzain. Despite its relevance, the mechanism of inhibition of cruzain by thiosemicarbazones is unknown. Here, we combined experiments and simulations to unveil the covalent inhibition mechanism of cruzain by a thiosemicarbazone-based inhibitor (compound 1). Additionally, we studied a semicarbazone (compound 2), which is structurally similar to compound 1 but does not inhibit cruzain. Assays confirmed the reversibility of inhibition by compound 1 and suggested a two-step mechanism of inhibition. The Ki was estimated to be 36.3 μM and Ki* to be 11.5 μM, suggesting the pre-covalent complex to be relevant for inhibition. Molecular dynamics simulations of compounds 1 and 2 with cruzain were used to propose putative binding modes for the ligands. One-dimensional (1D) quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) potential of mean force (PMF) and gas-phase energies showed that the attack of Cys25-S- on the C═S or C═O bond yields a more stable intermediate than the attack on the C═N bond of the thiosemicarbazone/semicarbazone. Two-dimensional (2D) QM/MM PMF revealed a putative reaction mechanism for compound 1, involving the proton transfer to the ligand, followed by the Cys25-S- attack at C═S. The ΔG and energy barrier were estimated to be −1.4 and 11.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Overall, our results shed light on the inhibition mechanism of cruzain by thiosemicarbazones. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","","Chagas Disease; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Humans; Protozoan Proteins; Semicarbazones; Thiosemicarbazones; Trypanosoma cruzi; Amines; Amino acids; Binding energy; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Phenols; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; cruzipain; cysteine proteinase; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; protozoal protein; semicarbazone derivative; thiosemicarbazone derivative; Chagas disease; Computational studies; Cruzain; Inhibition mechanisms; Potential of mean force; Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; Reversible inhibitions; Semicarbazones; Thiosemicarbazones; Trypanosoma cruzi; Chagas disease; chemistry; human; Trypanosoma cruzi; Ligands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148667721"

Significant advances have been reported in the last few years, with demonstrations of small- and medium-scale devices, as well as implementations of variants such as Gaussian Boson Sampling. Besides the relevance of this class of computational models in the quest for unambiguous experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage, recent results have also proposed the first applications for hybrid quantum computing. Here, we introduce the adoption of non-linear photon–photon interactions in the Boson Sampling framework, and analyze the enhancement in complexity via an explicit linear-optical simulation scheme. By extending the computational expressivity of Boson Sampling, the introduction of non-linearities promises to disclose novel functionalities for this class of quantum devices. Hence, our results are expected to lead to new applications of near-term, restricted photonic quantum computers. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Photons; Quantum computers; Computational modelling; Experimental demonstrations; Fock state; Gaussians; Linear optical; Medium-scale; Non linear; Optical interferometer; Quantum Computing; Small scale; Bosons","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146645627"

The charge displacement results suggest that in the formation of HeLi + , HeBe + , and HeBe 2 + , the neutral He atom undergoes, in the electric field of the ion, a pronounced electronic polarization, and the natural bond order theoretical approach indicates that in the formation of the molecular orbital He acts as a weak electron donor. The energy decomposition analysis provides the dispersion and induction components as the attractive leading terms controlling the stability of all systems, confirming that the formed bond substantially maintains a non-covalent nature which is also supported by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analysis. Finally, it was found that the HeLi and HeBe neutral systems are unstable under any condition, HeLi + and HeBe + ionic systems are stable below 317K and 138K, respectively, while the HeBe 2 + system becomes unstable only after 3045K. Computational and theoretical techniques: The potential energy curves and interactions in all systems were studied theoretically based on coupled-cluster singles and doubles method with perturbative inclusion of triples CCSD(T) method with an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.

A conventional nearest neighbor interpolation was adopted to implement quantum image up-scaling and down-scaling operations, from which two other scaling applications were developed. One such technique is a form of quantum steganography based on end-to-end encryption, which provides high capacity while ensuring the security of carrier images and secret messages.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of dark energy on the time-dependent Schrödinger–Newton equations by including a new source term with energy density proportional to the cosmological constant (Formula presented.), in addition to the particle-mass source term. The resulting Schrödinger–Newton– (Formula presented.) (S-N- (Formula presented.)) system cannot be solved exactly, in closed form, and one must resort to either numerical or semianalytical (i.e., series) solution methods. We apply the Adomian Decomposition Method, a very powerful method for solving a large class of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, to obtain accurate series solutions of the S-N- (Formula presented.) system, for the first time. The dark energy dominated regime is also investigated in detail. We then compare our results to existing numerical solutions and analytical estimates and show that they are consistent with previous findings. Finally, we outline the advantages of using the Adomian Decomposition Method, which allows accurate solutions of the S-N- (Formula presented.) system to be obtained quickly, even with minimal computational resources. The extensive use of the Adomian Decomposition Method in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory may open new mathematical, and physical, perspectives on obtaining semi-analytical solutions for some complex problems of quantum theory. © 2023 by the authors.","Adomian Decomposition Method; dark energy; series solutions; time-dependent Schrödinger–Newton equations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149205074"

However, demonstrations of the usefulness of such NISQ devices are still rare. In this work, we consider a practical railway dispatching problem: delay and conflict management on single-track railway lines. We examine the train dispatching consequences of the arrival of an already delayed train to a given network segment. This problem is computationally hard and needs to be solved almost in real time. We introduce a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model of this problem, which is compatible with the emerging quantum annealing technology. The model’s instances can be executed on present-day quantum annealers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve selected real-life problems from the Polish railway network using D-Wave quantum annealers. As a reference, we also provide solutions calculated with classical methods, including the conventional solution of a linear integer version of the model as well as the solution of the QUBO model using a tensor network-based algorithm. Our preliminary results illustrate the degree of difficulty of real-life railway instances for the current quantum annealing technology. Moreover, our analysis shows that the new generation of quantum annealers (the advantage system) does not perform well on those instances, either. © 2023 by the authors.","quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO); quantum annealing; railway dispatching problem","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148962580"

Furthermore, the created individuals are updated using an adaptive rotation angle operator that helps refine new individuals to converge to the optimal solution. We performed comparative tests with other quantum evolutionary algorithms and the classical genetic algorithm to demonstrate that this proposal performed better with the tested problem.

A network of hydrogen bonds in both polymorphs plays an important role on solid-state stability, charge transfer process and degradation reactions (when exposed to high humidity, temperature and/or pH changes). Computational Procedures: Supramolecular arrangement was proposed by Hirshfeld surface using the CrystalExplorer17 software and quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The electronic structure properties were calculated using the functional hybrid M06-2X with 6–311++G** base function employing diffuse and polarization functions to improve the description of hydrogen atoms on intermolecular interactions. Also, the H+ charge transfer between enalapril and maleate molecules was performed using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics with the Verlet algorithm. In both simulations, the temperature of the ionic system was maintained around 300 K using the Nosé-Hoover thermostat and the electronic system evolved without the use of the thermostat. Results: This work evaluates the effect of maleate on the structural stability of enalapril maleate solid state. The electronic structural analysis points out a partially covalent character for N1-H∙∙∙O7 interaction; and the molecular dynamic showed a decentralized hydrogen on maleate driving a decomposition by charge transfer process while a centered hydrogen driving the stabilization. The charge transfer process and the mobility of the proton (H+) between enalapril and maleate molecules was demonstrated using supramolecular modeling analyses and molecular dynamics calculations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Charge transfer; CPMD; Enalapril maleate; Hirshfeld surface; M06-2X 6–311 + + G**","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Drug Stability; Enalapril; Hydrogen; Maleates; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; enalapril maleate; hydrogen; proton; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; enalapril; maleic acid; Article; controlled study; decomposition; drug degradation; drug stability; humidity; hydrogen bond; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; pH; polarization; solid state; surface property; temperature; chemistry; molecular dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160884599"

A prerequisite for applying quantum algorithms to a wide range of real-world problems is loading classical data to a quantum state. Several circuit-based methods have been proposed for encoding classical data as probability amplitudes of a quantum state. However, in these methods, either quantum circuit depth or width must grow linearly with the data size, nullifying the advantage of representing exponentially many classical data in a quantum state. In this paper, we present a configurable bidirectional procedure that addresses this problem by tailoring the resource trade-off between quantum circuit width and depth. In particular, we show a configuration that encodes an N-dimensional classical data using a quantum circuit whose width and depth both grow sublinearly with N. We demonstrate proof-of-principle implementations on five quantum computers accessed through the IBM and IonQ quantum cloud services. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bidirectional; Circuit optimization; Quantum computing; State preparation","Computation theory; Economic and social effects; Encoding (symbols); Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Bidirectional; Circuit optimization; Computational problem; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum state; Quantum state preparation; State preparation; Sublinear; Quantum computers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148691300"

Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is the most promising technology considered to implement reversible circuits, mainly due to the correspondence between features of reversible and QCA circuits. This work aims to push forward the state-of-the-art of the QCA-based reversible circuits implementation by proposing a novel QCA design of a reversible full adder\full subtractor (FA\FS). At first, we consider an efficient XOR-gate, and based on this, new QCA circuit layouts of Feynman, Toffoli, Peres, PQR, TR, RUG, URG, RQCA, and RQG are proposed. The efficient XOR gate significantly reduces the required clock phases and circuit area. As a result, all the proposed reversible circuits are efficient regarding cell count, delay, and circuit area. Finally, based on the presented reversible gates, a novel QCA design of a reversible full adder\full subtractor (FA\FS) is proposed.

In this regard, octa-graphene is a carbon allotrope consisting of 4- and 8-membered rings in a single planar sheet, drawing the research community’s attention to study their inorganic analogs. Considering the promising properties of octa-graphene-like structures and the role of GaAs and GaP in semiconductor physics, this study aims to propose, for the first time, two novel inorganics buckled nanosheets based on the octa-graphene structure, the octa-GaAs and octa-GaP. This work investigated the structural, electronic, and vibrational properties of these novel octa-graphene-based materials. The octa-GaP and octa-GaAs have an indirect band gap transition with a valence band maximum between M and Г points and a conduction band minimum at Г point with energy of 3.05 eV and 2.56 eV, respectively. The QTAIMC analysis indicates that both structures have incipient covalent in their bonds. The vibrational analysis demonstrates the occurrence of ΓRaman = 6Ag + 6Bg and ΓRaman = 12A′ + 12B″ for octa-GaP and octa-GaAs, respectively. The symmetry reduction of octa-GaAs leads to activating inactive modes observed in the octa-GaP structure. The frontier crystalline orbitals are composed by Ga(px) and P(py and pz) orbitals for octa-GaP and Ga(px and py) and As(s, py, and pz) for octa-GaAs in the valence bands while in the conduction bands by Ga(py, pz, and s) for both compounds and P(px and pz) and As(py). The phonon bands demonstrate the absence of the negative frequency modes and the structural stability of these new nanosheets. This report aims to reveal the fundamental properties of both newfound materials for stimulating experimental research groups in the search for synthesis routes to obtain this structure. Methods: This work used the DFT/B3LYP approach implemented in the CRYSTAL17 computational package. Ga, As, and P atomic centers were described by triple-zeta valence with polarization (TZVP) basis set. The vibrational analysis was carried out via coupled-perturbed Hartree–Fock/Kohn Sham (CPHF/KS) method, and the chemical bonds were evaluated via the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals (QTAIMC). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buckling; GaAs; GaP; Octa-GaAs; Octa-GaP; Octa-graphene; T-graphene","gallium; gallium arsenide; gallium phosphide; graphene; nanosheet; octa graphene; unclassified drug; Article; calculation; chemical bond; chemical structure; crystal structure; density functional theory; photocatalysis; polarization; quantum theory; solar energy; static electricity; synthesis; wireless communication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161047827"

In QCA, wire crossings can be coplanar or multilayer. However, sudden changes in polarization levels can cause the system to enter a metastable state, leading to delays or incorrect processing. The tunneling mechanism of QCA basic units requires external clock signals to ensure changes occur adiabatically and at a desirable moment. This paper presents multistage interconnections that can minimize the overall area, encompassing the resources required for the wiring crossings. Furthermore, the proposed interconnection utilizes the regular USE clock scheme. Our design offers significant improvements over previous work. First, we achieve a 7.2× reduction in the multistage switch area. Additionally, our multistage QCA methodology could address the issue of wire crossing in multilevel QCA circuit design, yielding placement and routing solutions that closely approach the current state-of-the-art, even when employing a simple greedy approach.  © 2023 IEEE.","Clocking schemes; nanotechnologies; Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata; USE","Cellular automata; Clocks; Integrated circuit manufacture; Nanocrystals; Timing circuits; Clock schemes; Clocking schemes; Computing paradigm; Electric current flow; Multi-stages; Non-blocking; Quantum-dot cellular automata; Transfer information; USE; Wire crossings; Semiconductor quantum dots","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174907443"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely employed as a significant tool to diagnose dystrophinopathies. Though MRI is effective, it is mainly based on personal experiences and can simply result in misdiagnosis. This study designs a multi-objective quantum tunicate swarm optimization with deep learning (MOQTSO-DL) model to diagnose dystrophinopathies using muscle MRI images. The proposed model involves a RoI detection process by an optimized region growing approach where the initial seed points and thresholds are effectively determined by the MOQTSO algorithm. Besides, capsule network (CapsNet) is employed as a feature extractor to derive an optimal set of features. Moreover, MOQTSO with extreme learning machine (ELM) based classifier is used to allocate appropriate class labels for the muscle MRI images. The design of the MOQTSO algorithm for the initial seed point selection of RoI detection and parameter tuning of the ELM model depicts the novelty of the work. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to showcase the improved performance of the proposed method.

However, recent decades have seen a proliferation of natural, artificial and social complex systems which defy its bases and make it inapplicable. This paradigmatic theory has been generalized in 1988 into the nonextensive statistical mechanics—as currently referred to—grounded on the nonadditive entropy (Formula presented.) as well as its corresponding continuous and quantum counterparts.

Various multiobjective optimization algorithms work fine for bi-objective problems with few variables. However, many problems involve several functions that handle many variables each, and there is no efficient mathematical method to solve these types of problems. Quantum computers offer an exponential speed-up for such problems when they take full advantage of quantum phenomena. At present, quantum multiobjective problem solvers for quantum computers do not exist. This paper presents a formal statistical analysis of two state-of-the-art classical multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and three quantum-inspired multiobjective optimization algorithms to determine whether quantum solvers can provide comparatively optimal quality solutions or if they are limited. One of the quantum-inspired algorithms tested is a novel proposal that uses fewer qubits. The paper also presents contributions to the state of the art by modifying two original, quantum-inspired algorithms to perform in continuous search spaces. The purpose of this paper is to settle the first step of multiobjective quantum optimization for quantum computers from quantum-inspired algorithms by providing valuable results that can assist in future research along the way in this field. The results indicated that the quantum-inspired algorithms tested performed as well as the NSGA-II, and the proposed method outperforms the other quantum-inspired algorithms in problems with constraints and complicated Pareto sets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Multiobjective optimization; Numeric optimization; Quantum computing; Quantum-inspired","Evolutionary algorithms; Functions; Quantum theory; Qubits; Continuous spaces; Multi-objective problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Numeric optimization; Optimization algorithms; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Quantum-inspired; State of the art; Multiobjective optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126337015"

However, finding the optimum structures is a bottleneck due to the huge search space, and global search algorithms have been used successfully for this purpose. In this work, we present the quantum machine learning software/agent for materials design and discovery (QMLMaterial), intended for automatic structural determination in silico for several chemical systems: atomic clusters, atomic clusters and the spin multiplicity together, doping in clusters or solids, vacancies in clusters or solids, adsorption of molecules or adsorbents on surfaces, and finally atomic clusters on solid surfaces/materials or encapsulated in porous materials. QMLMaterial is an artificial intelligence (AI) software based on the active learning method, which uses machine learning regression algorithms and their uncertainties for decision making on the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing the probability of finding the global minimum with few calculations as more data is obtained. The software has different acquisition functions for decision making (e.g., expected improvement and lower confidence bound). Also, the Gaussian process is available in the AI framework for regression, where the uncertainty is obtained analytically from Bayesian statistics. For the artificial neural network and support vector regressor algorithms, the uncertainty can be obtained by K-fold cross-validation or nonparametric bootstrap resampling methods. The software is interfaced with several quantum chemistry codes and atomic descriptors, such as the many-body tensor representation. QMLMaterial’s capabilities are highlighted in the current work by its applications in the following systems: Na20, Mo6C3 (where the spin multiplicity was considered), H2O@CeNi3O5, Mg8@graphene, Na3Mg3@CNT (carbon nanotube). © 2023 American Chemical Society","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170717497"

To build good error correction schemes, it is essential to understand how noise affects the behavior of these codes. In this research paper, we analyze Steane code, a 7-qubit QECC, using a randomized benchmarking (RB) protocol. With RB protocols, we can partially characterize the quality of implementation of a set of quantum gates. We show a scenario where Steane code with one logical qubit is advantageous compared to the situation with no quantum code.

The framework maps a training data set or a single data sample to the quantum state of a physical system through quantum feature maps. The quantum state of the arbitrarily large training data set summarises its probability distribution in a finite-dimensional quantum wave function. By projecting the quantum state of a new data sample onto the quantum state of the training data set, one can derive statistics to classify or estimate the density of the new data sample. Remarkably, the implementation of our framework on a real quantum device does not require any optimisation of quantum circuit parameters.

NEXMD is a computational package particularly developed to perform simulations of the photoexcitation and subsequent nonadiabatic electronic and vibrational energy relaxation in large multichromophoric conjugated molecules involving several coupled electronic excited states. The NEXMD-SANDER exchange has been optimized in order to achieve excited-state adiabatic dynamics simulations of large conjugated materials in a QM/MM environment, such as an explicit solvent. Dynamics of a substituted polyphenylene vinylene oligomer (PPV3-NO2) in vacuum and different explicit solvents has been used as a test case by performing comparative analysis of changes in its optical spectrum, state-dependent conformational changes, and quantum bond orderings. The method has been tested and compared with respect to previous implicit solvent implementations. Also, the impact on the expansion of the QM region by including a variable number of solvent molecules has been analyzed. Altogether, these results encourage future implementations of NEXMD simulations using the same combination of methods.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Quantum Theory; Solvents; solvent; chemistry; molecular dynamics; quantum theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138049038"

In this realm, molecular descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs) based on molecular geometry have yielded promising results for a variety of ML tasks. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies trained and validated their model with geometries optimized through density functional theory (DFT), implying that geometries at the same level of theory will be available for unseen molecular data. Unfortunately, generating these 3D geometries is computationally expensive, limiting their application to explore a myriad of molecular candidates. In contrast, universal function approximators such as neural nets (NNs) can learn any desired function, meaning that GNNs can map non-equilibrium geometries to predict ground-state properties. In this sense, this work investigates the impact of a computationally fast (but less accurate) method to predict molecular properties calculated at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(2df, p) level. Precisely, we assess the predictive performance of the enn-s2s model for twelve molecular properties from the QM9 dataset with geometries optimized via the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) and DFT B3LYP/6-31G(2df, p) framework. As a result, 9 out of 12 properties demonstrated a low error gap between feeding the enn-s2s with the MMFF94- and DFT-optimized geometry, thus confirming NNs as a feasible strategy to overcome the before-mentioned limitation for practical application.  © 2022 IEEE.","geometry optimization; graph neural network; property prediction","Costs; Density functional theory; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Ground state; Inverse problems; Machine learning; Molecular structure; B3LYP/6-31G; Density-functional-theory; Geometry optimization; Graph neural networks; Low-costs; Machine learning algorithms; Material science; Molecular geometries optimization; Molecular properties; Property predictions; Geometry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152215326"

Different methods of molecular mechanics (three AMBER force fields) and quantum mechanics (MP2 level of ab initio and DFT) were used. The calculations showed that the main results and conclusions do not depend on the method used. The minimum energy structures for each nucleoside have been found both in syn and anti-base-deoxyribose orientations, and with C3’-endo and C2’-endo sugar puckering. For pyrimidine-nucleosides minima with syn-orientations correspond to intramolecular H-bond. For purine nucleosides minima with syn-orientation both with and without such H bonds have been found. The structures with intranucleoside H bonds are possible only at the 5’-end of polynucleotide chain. The most favorable structures without H bonds correspond to nucleoside conformations in classical B-form of DNA duplex, as well as in some other conformational classes of DNA minimum fragments.

It is accountable for data management and processing through virtual machines and is independent of end users’ system configurations. The usage of cloud systems is very simple and easy to organize. They can easily be integrated into various storages of the cloud and incorporated into almost all available software tools such as Hadoop, Informatica, DataStage, and OBIEE for the purpose of Extraction-Transform-Load (ETL), data processing, data reporting, and other related computations. Because of this low-cost-based cloud computational service model, cloud users can utilize the software and services, the implementation environment, storage, and other on-demand resources with a pay-per-use model. Cloud contributors across this world move all these cloud-based apps, software, and large volumes of data in the form of files and databases into enormous data centers. However, the main challenge is that cloud users cannot have direct control over the data stored at these data centers. They do not even know the integrity, confidentiality, level of security, and privacy of their sensitive data. This exceptional cloud property creates several different security disputes and challenges. To address these security challenges, we propose a novel Quantum Hash-centric Cipher Policy-Attribute-based Encipherment (QH-CPABE) framework to improve the security and privacy of the cloud user’s sensitive data. In our proposed model, we used both structured and unstructured big cloud clinical data as input so that the simulated experimental results conclude that the proposal has precise, resulting in approximately 92% correctness of bit hash change and approximately 96% correctness of chaotic dynamic key production, enciphered and deciphered time as compared with conventional standards from the literature. © 2022 by the authors.","cloud model; privacy; QH-CPABE; security","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141740467"

The perturbed density operators are a specified “distance"" away from the state described by the original density operator. This approach is applied to a bipartite system of qubits and used to examine the sensitivity of various entanglement measures on the perturbation magnitude. The constraint sets used include constant energy, constant entropy, and both constant energy and entropy. The method is then applied to produce perturbed random quantum states that correspond with those obtained experimentally for Bell states on the IBM quantum device ibmq_manila. The results show that the methodology can be used to simulate the outcome of real quantum devices where noise, which is important both in theory and simulation, is present. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Entanglement; IBMQ; Perturbed quantum states; Qiskit; Quantum computation; Random quantum states","Computation theory; Entropy; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Constant energy; Density operators; Entanglement; IBMQ; Perturbed quantum state; Qiskit; Quantum device; Quantum state; Random quantum state; Quantum computers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138187792"

Each geometry from the IRC had its wavefunction computed and the topology of the electronic density for it was then evaluated. By means of IQA, the global energetic profile was partitioned among the various atoms in the molecule, providing insight into what atoms are the main ones responsible for the magnitude of the energy barriers. The (a)synchronicity of the reaction mechanisms featuring non-symmetrically substituted dienophiles was characterized, from QTAIM, by the electron densities and Laplacians over the LCP's as well as by the different atomic energy barriers obtained from IQA. The magnitude of the atomic barrier nicely explains the (a)synchronicity of the reaction mechanisms, and the degree of (a)synchronicity is nicely revealed by the difference between the earlier and later bond breaking and bond formations. The main conclusion is that important energetic and electronic changes are occurring before and after the position of the transition state structure, mainly for those asynchronous mechanisms, and although these provide essential insight into the reaction mechanism, most studies cannot assess this kind of information because they are focusing solely on reactants, transition states, and products. We advocate that the additional computational effort required for such analyses is more than compensated by the great amount of useful information it provides. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Asynchronous; BCP; Cycloaddition; Diels–Alder; IQA; Pericyclic; QTAIM","Cycloaddition Reaction; Cyclopentanes; Electronics; Models, Molecular; Quantum Theory; Atoms; Chemical bonds; Computation theory; Cycloaddition; Density functional theory; acrylonitrile; cyclopentadiene derivative; cyclopentane derivative; Asynchronoi; BCP; Cycloadditions; Diels-Alder; Diels-Alder reaction; Interacting quantum atom; Pericyclic; QTAIM; Quantum atoms; Reaction mechanism; Article; atom; calculation; chemical interaction; chemical reaction; cycloaddition; density functional theory; Diels Alder reaction; electron; energy transfer; geometry; interacting quantum atom; intrinsic reaction coordinate; line critical point; molecule; nuclear energy; reaction analysis; chemistry; electronics; molecular model; quantum theory; Energy barriers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143180347"

Consequently, its numerical modeling plays a vital role in systems that perform computer aided-diagnosis in Ophthalmology. In the present chapter, a novel method for the automatic modeling of the MTA is introduced. The method consists of the steps of automatic MTA segmentation and numerical modeling based on spline curves and the use of the Quantum genetic algorithm (QGA). In this step, the QGA is analyzed and implemented in order to determine the optimal control points on a set of previously segmented vessel pixels of the MTA in retinal fundus images. These control points are used to generate the best curve to fit the MTA through spline curves. In the experimental results, the proposed method was evaluated in terms of the Mean distance to the closest point and Hausdorff distance obtaining the average values of 9.91 and 53.32, respectively, using a test set of images. Finally, in terms of computational time, the proposed method achieved an average of 7.51 s per image, which makes it suitable for computer-aided diagnosis in ophthalmology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151925772"

The results were compared to those obtained with the G2 theory for the same set of molecules. The G3(MP2)//B3-SBK theory showed a mean deviation and deviation standard equal to 3.7 kcal mol−1 and 6.0 kcal mol−1, respectively. The G2 theory (mean deviation = 3.1 kcal mol−1 and standard deviation = 4.9 kcal mol−1) presented a lower error and standard deviation, but at a significantly higher computational cost. For a more complete evaluation, as a secondary part of the work, it also used different functionals B3LYP, M06-2X, WB97XD, and MP2 method with four different basis sets 6-311G(d,p), LANL2DZ, jorge-ADZP, and CEP-31G(d). The best density functional/basis set combination was obtained with M06-2X/CEP-31G(d) among the three mentioned functionals. However, the produced mean deviation is significant and equal to 17.3 kcal mol−1, with a standard deviation equal to 23.0 kcal mol−1. The 6-311G(d,p) basis achieved the best performance with the MP2 method, generating an equally significant mean deviation of 12.8 kcal mol−1 with a standard deviation equal to 18.7 kcal mol−1. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Density functional theory; G2 theory; G3(MP2)//B3-SBK theory; Iodine compounds; MP2","Iodine Compounds; Quantum Theory; Thermodynamics; iodine; iodine derivative; Article; controlled study; cost; density functional theory; enthalpy; error; evaluation study; quantum theory; thermodynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135407303"

One of the most successful techniques to obtain solutions of the YBE was given by Rump, who introduced an algebraic structure called the brace, which allows giving non-degenerate involutive set-theoretical solutions.

Efficient simulation, however, can be achieved for certain classes of quantum states, in particular the so-called Gaussian quantum states of continuous variable systems. In this work we introduce QuGIT - a python numerical toolbox based on symplectic methods specialized in efficiently simulating multimode Gaussian states and operations. QuGIT is exact, requiring no truncation of Hilbert space, and provides a wide range of Gaussian operations on arbitrary Gaussian states, including unitaries, partial traces, tensor products, general-dyne measurements, conditional and unconditional dynamics. To illustrate the toolbox, several examples of usage relevant to quantum optics and optomechanics are described.

The computed free energy profiles suggest that a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine on the inhibitor warhead and proton transfer from the catalytic histidine occur in a concerted manner. The results indicate that the reaction is more strongly exergonic for the alkyne-based inhibitors, which bind irreversibly to cathepsin K, than for the nitrile-based inhibitor odanacatib, which binds reversibly. Gas-phase energies were also calculated for the addition of methanethiol to structural prototypes for a number of warheads of interest in cysteine protease inhibitor design in order to assess electrophilicity. The approaches presented in this study are particularly applicable to assessment of novel warheads, and computed transition state geometries can be incorporated into molecular models for covalent docking.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Catalysis; Cathepsin K; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protease Inhibitors; Quantum Theory; Amino acids; Mechanics; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; cathepsin K; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; proteinase inhibitor; Catalytic cysteines; Cysteine protease inhibitors; Dynamics simulation; Energy; Energy profile; Free energy surface; Gas-phases; Nucleophilic attack; Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; Reaction mechanism; catalysis; chemistry; metabolism; molecular dynamics; quantum theory; Free energy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138078420"

Additionally, ultracold atomic quantum gases have also become essential platforms to study superfluidity. Here, we explore the analogy between superconductivity and superfluidity to present an intriguing effect caused by a thin finite barrier in a quasi-one-dimensional toroidal spinor Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). In this system, the atomic current density flowing through the edges of the barrier oscillates, such as the electrical current through a Josephson junction in a superconductor, but in our case, there is no current circulation through the barrier. We also show how the nontrivial broken-symmetry states of spinor BECs change the structure of this Josephson-like current, creating the possibility to probe the spinor symmetry, solely using measurements of this superfluid current. © 2022 by the authors.

One of these cryptographic systems is NewHope that is a RING-LWE based key exchange scheme. The NewHope Key Encapsulation Method (KEM) allows to establish an encapsulated (secret) key shared by two participants. This scheme defines a private key that is used to encipher a random shared secret and the private key enables the deciphering. This paper presents Fault Information Leakage attacks, using conventional personal computers, if the attacked participant, say Bob, reuses his public key. This assumption is not so strong since reusing the pair (secret, public) keys saves Bob’s device computing cost when the public global parameter is not changed. With our result we can conclude that, to prevent leakage, Bob should not reuse his NewHope secret and public keys because Bob’s secret key can be retrieved with only 2 communications. We also found that Bob’s secret keys can be retrieved for NewHopeToy2, NewHopeToy1 and NewHopeLudicrous with 1, 2, and 3 communications, respectively.

In general, creating extended molecular trajectories can be a computationally expensive process, for example, when running ab-initio simulations. Hence, repeating such calculations to either obtain more accurate thermodynamics or to get a higher resolution in the dynamics generated by a fine-grained quantum interaction can be time- and computational resource-consuming. In this work, we explore different machine learning methodologies to increase the resolution of MD trajectories on-demand within a post-processing step. As a proof of concept, we analyse the performance of bi-directional neural networks (NNs) such as neural ODEs, Hamiltonian networks, recurrent NNs and long short-term memories, as well as the uni-directional variants as a reference, for MD simulations (here: the MD17 dataset). We have found that Bi-LSTMs are the best performing models; by utilizing the local time-symmetry of thermostated trajectories they can even learn long-range correlations and display high robustness to noisy dynamics across molecular complexity. Our models can reach accuracies of up to 10-4 Å in trajectory interpolation, which leads to the faithful reconstruction of several unseen high-frequency molecular vibration cycles. This renders the comparison between the learned and reference trajectories indistinguishable. The results reported in this work can serve (1) as a baseline for larger systems, as well as (2) for the construction of better MD integrators.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Present public-key algorithms depend on the difficulty of deciphering the discrete log and factorization problem of large prime numbers. Shor's algorithm can be used to break the hash signatures by quantum computers. Therefore, it is necessary for the development of a post-quantum secure signature scheme or quantum-resistant blockchain for post-quantum blockchain security.

Nonetheless, the need to accelerate significantly computational processing that requires a considerable amount of time through classical computing for solving complex problems; are just a few reasons why quantum machine learning algorithms are being implemented in this field. Image classification is a frequent computer vision problems to solve using deep learning algorithms, evaluating their performance via well-known datasets. In this work, we compare the performance of the LeNet5 neural network with a quantum version of itself, in which a fixed non-trainable quantum circuit is used as a quanvolution kernel. The contribution of this work focuses on analyzing the disadvantages and advantages of a quanvolution kernel in image classification problems. The results show that using a quanvolutional layer achieves a favorable performance tradeoff over a classical CNN LeNet5 model. We used the MNIST hand-written digits dataset to perform the evaluation using well-known metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1 score, latency, throughput, and others. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CNN; Deep learning; Image classification; MNIST; Quantum computing; Quanvolutional","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162259045"

When information is lost in conventional circuits, it will not be recoverable, as a result, the circuits are provided based on the reversible logic and according to reversible gates for data retrieval. Since comparators are one of the basic building blocks in digital logic design, in which they compare two numbers, the aim of this research is to design a 1-bit comparator building block based on reversible logic and implement it in the QCA with the minimum cell consumption, less occupied area, and lower latency, as well as to design it in a single layer.

Moruzzi 1, Pisa, I-56124, Italy","The wide range of time/length scales covered by self-assembly in soft matter makes molecular dynamics (MD) the ideal candidate for simulating such a supramolecular phenomenon at an atomistic level. However, the reliability of MD outcomes heavily relies on the accuracy of the adopted force-field (FF). The spontaneous re-ordering in liquid crystalline materials stands as a clear example of such collective self-assembling processes, driven by a subtle and delicate balance between supramolecular interactions and single-molecule flexibility. General-purpose transferable FFs often dramatically fail to reproduce such complex phenomena, for example, the error on the transition temperatures being larger than 100 K. Conversely, quantum-mechanically derived force-fields (QMD-FFs), specifically tailored for the target system, were recently shown (J. Phys. Chem. Lett.2022,13, 243) to allow for the required accuracy as they not only well reproduced transition temperatures but also yielded a quantitative agreement with the experiment on a wealth of structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties. The main drawback of this strategy stands in the computational burden connected to the numerous quantum mechanical (QM) calculations usually required for a target-specific parameterization, which has undoubtedly hampered the routine application of QMD-FFs. In this work, we propose a fragment-based strategy to extend the applicability of QMD-FFs, in which the amount of QM calculations is significantly reduced, being a single-molecule-optimized geometry and its Hessian matrix the only QM information required. To validate this route, a new FF is assembled for a large mesogen, exploiting the parameters obtained for two smaller liquid crystalline molecules, in this and previous work. Lengthy MD simulations are carried out with the new transferred QMD-FF, observing again a spontaneous re-orientation in the correct range of temperatures, with good agreement with the available experimental measures. The present results strongly suggest that a partial transfer of QMD-FF parameters can be invoked without a significant loss of accuracy, thus paving the way to exploit the method's intrinsic predictive capabilities in the simulation of novel soft materials.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Liquid Crystals; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Quantum Theory; Reproducibility of Results; Thermodynamics; liquid crystal; molecular dynamics; quantum theory; reproducibility; thermodynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140645927"

To investigate whether this is inherent to the method, we calculate here the ESA spectra of small-to-medium-sized oligophenylenevinylenes (nPV) and oligothiophenes (nT) using QR TD-DFT as well as CASPT2 based on CASSCF geometries. CASPT2 gives indeed a reliable, theoretically correct description of the ESA features for all compounds; the computational effort can be reduced without significant loss of accuracy using TD-DFT geometries. QR TD-DFT, based on BHandHLYP and CAM-/B3LYP functionals, fails on short nTs but provides a reasonable description for spectral positions of nPVs and long nTs. The failure on short nTs is, however, only partly due to the incomplete configuration description but, in particular, related to an improper MO description, resulting in an asymmetric energy spacing of the occupied vs unoccupied MOs in the DFT scheme. Longer nTs, on the other side, adapt approximately the MO scheme for alternant hydrocarbons just like in nPVs, while contributions by two triplet excitations combined to a singlet (which inhibits an accurate treatment of polyenes with standard TD-DFT) do not play a relevant role in the current case. For such ""well-behaved"" systems, a reasonable representation of ESA spectra is found at the QR TD-DFT level due to the rather small energy shifts when including higher-order excitations. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

By implication, 6G capabilities present a massive benefit for the Internet of Things (IoT), considering a wide range of application domains. However, some security concerns in the IoT involving authentication and encryption protocols are currently under investigation. Thus, mechanisms implementing quantum communications in IoT devices have been explored to offer improved security. Algorithmic solutions that enable better quantum key distribution (QKD) selection for authentication and encryption have been developed, but having limited performance considering time requirements. Therefore, a new approach for selecting the best QKD protocol based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model, called Tree-CNN, is proposed using the Tanh Exponential Activation Function (TanhExp) that enables IoT devices to handle more secure quantum communications using the 6G network infrastructure. The proposed model is developed, and its performance is compared with classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other machine learning methods. The results obtained are superior to the related works, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.89% during testing and a time-cost performance of 0.65 s for predicting the best QKD protocol. In addition, we tested our proposal using different transmission distances and three QKD protocols to demonstrate that the prediction and actual results reached similar values. Hence, our proposed model obtained a fast, reliable, and precise solution to solve the challenges of performance and time consumption in selecting the best QKD protocol. © 2022 by the authors.","6G networks; deep convolutional neural network; internet of things; quantum communications; quantum security","artificial neural network; Internet; machine learning; performance assessment; software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143835208"

Circularly polarized radiation interacting with a superconducting condensate acts as an effective magnetic field that can generate supercurrents and DC magnetic moments through the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). Using the time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau (TDGL) equation formalism, the current-carrying states of a small superconducting ring illuminated by such radiation is calculated. Numerical simulations demonstrate the possibility to on-demand switch between current-carrying states in the superconductor by controlling the helicity of the electromagnetic field polarization.

Despite this data exchange using the most modern security techniques, vehicles have been the target of constant cyber-attacks. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing have been tested to minimize these attacks. Particularly, this work investigates the possibility of using post-quantum computing techniques in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, more specifically in AVs. Considering the functionalities of a vehicle nowadays, it is possible to say that a vehicle is composed of a set of IoT devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a post-quantum secure method to be used in IoT devices for data exchange between AVs and a 5G base station. In this method, the post-quantum algorithm NTRU is implemented in an edge computing IoT architecture between the source of the CVs data and the edge layer, which is a vulnerable spot for quantum-attacks.

A detailed vectorial characterization of the focused optical fields that includes a description beyond the paraxial approximation is key to optimize technological performance as well as for the design of meaningful experiments and interpret properly their results. Here, we present PyFocus, an open-source Python software package to perform fully vectorial calculations of focused electromagnetic fields after modulation by an arbitrary phase mask and in the presence of a multilayer system. We provide a graphical user interface and high-level functions to easily integrate PyFocus into custom scripts. Furthermore, to demonstrate the potential of PyFocus, we apply it to extensively characterize the generation of toroidal foci with a high numerical aperture objective, as it is commonly done in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods such as STED or MINFLUX. We provide examples of the effects of different experimental factors such as polarization, aberrations, and misalignments of key optical elements. Finally, we present calculations of toroidal foci through an interface of different mediums, and, to our knowledge, the first calculations of toroidal foci generated in total internal reflection conditions.

Such a case is found in stenosis detection using X-rays coronary angiography. In this study, the emerging field of quantum computing is applied in the context of hybrid neural networks. So, a hybrid transfer-learning paradigm is used for stenosis detection, where a quantum network drives and improves the performance of a pre-trained classical network. An intermediate layer between the classical and quantum network post-processes the classical features by mapping them into a hypersphere of fixed radius through a hyperbolic tangent function. Next, these normalized features are processed in the quantum network, and through a SoftMax function, the class probabilities are obtained: stenosis and non-stenosis. Furthermore, a distributed variational quantum circuit is implemented to split the data into multiple quantum circuits within the quantum network, improving the training time without compromising the stenosis detection performance. The proposed method is evaluated on a small X-ray coronary angiography dataset containing 250 image patches (50%–50% of positive and negative stenosis cases). The hybrid classical–quantum network significantly outperformed the classical network. Evaluation results showed a boost concerning the classical transfer learning paradigm in the accuracy of 9%, recall of 20%, and F1-score of 11%, reaching 91.8033%, 94.9153%, and 91.8033%, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coronary angiography; Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network; Quantum computing; Stenosis detection; X-ray imaging","Angiography; Convolution; Deep learning; Digital storage; Heart; Hyperbolic functions; Medical applications; Classical-quantum; Convolutional neural network; Coronary angiography; Hybrid convolutional neural network; Quantum Computing; Quantum network; Stenoses; Stenosis detection; X-ray coronary angiographies; X-ray imaging; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118476460"

Characterized as a metalloprotease, gp63 can be powerfully inactivated in the presence of a metal chelator. In this study, we first used the structural parameters of a 7-hydroxycoumarin derivative, L1 compound, to evaluate the theoretical–computational experiments against gp63, comparing it with an available metal chelator already described. The methodology followed was (i) analysis of the three-dimensional structure of gp63 as well as its active site, and searching the literature and molecular databases for possible inhibitors; (ii) molecular docking simulations and investigation of the interactions in the generated protein–ligand complexes; and (iii) the individual energy of the gp63 amino acids that interacted most with the ligands of interest was quantified by ab initio calculations using Molecular Fraction with Conjugated Caps (MFCC). MFCC still allowed the final quantum balance calculations of the protein interaction to be obtained with each inhibitor candidate binder. L1 obtained the best energy quantum balance result with −2 eV, followed by DETC (−1.4 eV), doxycycline (−1.3 eV), and 4-terpineol (−0.6 eV), and showed evidence of covalent binding in the enzyme active site. In vitro experiments confirmed L1 as highly effective against L. amazonensis parasites. The compound also exhibited a low cytotoxicity profile against mammalian RAW and 3T3 cells lines, presenting a selective index of 149.19 and 380.64 µM, respectively. L1 induced promastigote forms’ death by necrosis and the ultrastructural analysis revealed disruption in membrane integrity. Furthermore, leakage of the contents and destruction of the parasite were confirmed by Spectroscopy Dispersion analysis. These results together suggested L1 has a potential effect against L. amazonensis, the etiologic agent of diffuse leishmaniasis, and the only one that currently does not have a satisfactory treatment. © 2022 by the authors.","Leishmaniaspp; leishmanolysin; metalloprotease inhibitors; MFCC (Molecular Fractionation with Conjugate Caps)","Animals; Chelating Agents; Leishmania; Mammals; Metalloendopeptidases; Metalloproteases; Mice; Molecular Docking Simulation; Phagocytosis; 4 [[bis[(pyridine 2 il)metil]amino]metil] 7 hidroxy 2h 1 benzopyran 2 ona; amphotericin B; diethyldithiocarbamic acid; doxycycline; leishmanolysin; metalloproteinase; metalloproteinase inhibitor; protozoal protein; terpinen 4 ol; umbelliferone derivative; unclassified drug; chelating agent; metalloproteinase; 3T3 cell line; ab initio calculation; antiparasitic activity; Article; binding affinity; biochemistry; controlled study; covalent bond; drug identification; drug protein binding; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; evaluation study; IC50; in vitro study; Leishmania amazonensis; membrane damage; molecular docking; nonhuman; promastigote; protein structure; quantum chemistry; animal; Leishmania; mammal; metabolism; mouse; phagocytosis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136343107"

During the construction of a neural network, an expert can spend significant time designing a neural architecture with trial and error sessions. Because of the manual process, there is a greater interest in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which is an automated method of architectural search in neural networks. Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms present propitious results regarding faster convergence when compared to other solutions with restricted search space and high computational costs. In this work, we enhance the Q-NAS model: a quantum-inspired algorithm to search for deep networks by assembling substructures. We present a new architecture that was designed automatically by the Q-NAS and applied to a case study for COVID-19 vs. healthy classification. For this classification, the Q-NAS algorithm was able to find a network architecture with only 1.23 M parameters that reached the accuracy of 99.44%, which overcame benchmark networks like Inception (GoogleLeNet), EfficientNet and VGG that were also tested in this work.

The goal of the procedure is to apply quantum walk as a search algorithm in a complete graph to find all synaptic weights of a classical artificial neural network. Each vertex of this complete graph represents a possible synaptic weight set in the ww-dimensional search space, where ww is the number of weights of the neural network. To know the number of iterations required a priori to obtain the solutions is one of the main advantages of the procedure. Another advantage is that the proposed method does not stagnate in local minimums. Thus, it is possible to use the quantum walk search procedure as an alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The proposed method was employed for a XORXOR problem to prove the proposed concept. To solve this problem, the proposed method trained a classical artificial neural network with nine weights. However, the procedure can find solutions for any number of dimensions. The results achieved demonstrate the viability of the proposal, contributing to machine learning and quantum computing researches.  © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Artificial neural networks training; quantum computing; quantum walk; search algorithm","Backpropagation; Graph algorithms; Graph theory; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Complete graphs; Computational procedures; Number of iterations; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Search Algorithms; Search procedures; Synaptic weight; Neural networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099594420"

The claimed security services by blockchain have been proved using various cryptographic techniques, mainly public key infrastructure and digital signatures. However, the use of generic cryptographic primitives using large prime numbers or elliptic curves with logarithms is going to be an issue with quantum computers as those techniques are vulnerable in post-quantum era. Therefore, the paradigm shift from pre-quantum to the post-quantum era has necessitated new cryptographic developments which are robust against quantum attacks and applicable in blockchain for post-quantum decentralization. Therefore, we have presented a solution for post-quantum decentralization in the blockchain. It uses lattices with polynomials for identity-based encryption (IBE) and aggregate signatures for the consensus to ensure efficiency and suitability in post-quantum blockchain applications. We experiment the proposed approach based on delay, throughput, energy consumption and complexity.

From this approach, the authors were able to define a measure of (ir)realism, or (in)definiteness, of an observable given a preparation of a quantum system. As well, in [Phys. Rev. A 97, 022107 (2018)], Dieguez and Angelo studied the variation of reality of observables by introducing a map, called monitoring, through weak projective non-revealed measurements. The authors showed that an arbitrary-intensity unrevealed measurement of a given observable X generally increases its reality, also increasing the reality of its incompatible observables X′. However, from these results, natural questions arise: under the monitoring map of X, how much does the reality of X′ increase in comparison with that of X? Does it always increase? This is the kind of question we address in this article. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible that the variation of the reality of X′ is bigger than the variation of the reality of X. As well, the monitoring map of X does not affect the already established reality of X′, even when they are maximally incompatible. On the other hand, there are circumstances where the variation of reality of both observables is the same, even when they are maximally incompatible. Besides, we give a quantum circuit to implement the monitoring map and use it to experimentally verify the variation of reality of observables using IBM’s quantum computers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","(Ir)realism; Monitoring operation; Quantum computer; Weak measurements","Quantum computers; Quantum optics; (ir)realism; Einstein-Podolsky-rosen; Measurements of; Monitoring operation; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum system; Weak measurements; Monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134876059"

In this article, we exploit the Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) formalism to analyse multiloop topologies that appear for the first time at five loops. Explicitly, we open the loops into connected trees and group them according to their topological properties. Then, we identify a kernel generator, the so-called N (Formula presented.) MLT universal topology, that allows us to describe any scattering amplitude of up to five loops. Furthermore, we provide factorization and recursion relations that enable us to write these multiloop topologies in terms of simpler subtopologies, including several subsets of Feynman diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops. Our approach takes advantage of many symmetries present in the graphical description of the original fundamental five-loop topologies. The results obtained in this article might shed light into a more efficient determination of higher-order corrections to the running couplings, which are crucial in the current and future precision physics program. © 2022 by the authors.","higher-order calculations; multiloop Feynman integrals; perturbative QFT","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144902535"

However, modeling these kinds of systems in silico, such as finding the optimum adsorption geometry and energy, is challenging, due to the huge number of possibilities of assembling the adsorbate on the surface. In the current work, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) approach based on an active learning (AL) method for adsorption optimization on the surface of materials. AL uses machine learning (ML) regression algorithms and their uncertainties to make a decision (based on a policy) for the next unexplored structures to be computed, increasing, though, the probability of finding the global minimum with a small number of calculations. The methodology allows an accurate and automated structural elucidation of the adsorbate on the surface, based on the minimization of the total electronic energy. The new AL method for adsorption optimization was developed and implemented in the quantum machine learning software/agent for material design and discovery (QMLMaterial) program and was applied for C60@TiO2 anatase (101). It marks another software extension with a new feature in addition to the automatic structural elucidation of defects in materials and of nanoparticles as well. SCC-DFTB calculations were used to build the complex search surfaces with a reasonably low computational cost. An artificial neural network (NN) was employed in the AL framework evaluated together with two uncertainty quantification methods: K-fold cross-validation and non-parametric bootstrap (BS) resampling. Also, two different acquisition functions for decision-making were used: expected improvement (EI) and the lower confidence bound (LCB).

Industry 5.0 make use of collaborative robots (cobots) for optimizing productivity and ensuring safety. At the same time, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are predicted to be the main part of industry 5.0 in the forthcoming days. Regardless of high mobility and energy-limited UAVs for wireless communication as significant advantages, different issues are also existing in the UAV networks, such as security, reliability, etc. Several research works have focused on resolving security issues in UAV communication to support safety-critical applications. With this motivation, this article presents an artificial intelligence-based UAV-borne secure communication with classification (AIUAV-SCC) framework for industry 5.0 environment. The proposed AIUAV-SCC model involves two major phases namely image steganography-based secure communication and deep learning (DL)-based classification. At the initial stage, a new image steganography technique with multilevel discrete wavelet transformation, quantum bacterial colony optimization based optimal pixel selection, and encryption processes take place. Next, in the second stage, the Bayesian optimization (BO)-based SqueezeNet model is applied for the classification of securely received UAV images where the parameters in the SqueezeNet method are optimally tuned by the utilize of the BO technique. To validate the performance of the presented model, extensive simulations are applied using the UC Merced dataset (UCM) aerial dataset and the outcomes are investigated under several dimensions. The outcomes make sure the goodness of the presented model on test UCM aerial dataset over the compared methods.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Encryption; Image steganography; Industry 5.0; Secure communication; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Accident prevention; Cryptography; Deep learning; Discrete wavelet transforms; Distributed computer systems; Manufacture; Network security; Secure communication; Statistical tests; Bayesian optimization; Classification framework; Customisation; Image steganography; Industrial revolutions; Industry 5.0; Manufacturing complexity; Robotized manufacturing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle-borne; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131200268"

This side group was covalently bounded to the backbone through an n-hexyl chain to induce the intramolecular Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) process and thus improve the photovoltaic performance of the polymeric material. The polymer exhibited good solubility in common organic chlorinated solvents as well as thermal stability (TDT10% > 360 °C). Photophysical measurements demonstrated the occurrence of the FRET phenomenon between the lateral group and the terpolymer. The terpolymer exhibited an absorption band centered at 501 nm, an optical bandgap of 2.02 eV, and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.30 eV and −3.28 eV, respectively. A preliminary study on terpolymer-based OSC devices showed a low power-conversion efficiency (PCE) but a higher performance than devices based on an analogous polymer without the fluorescein derivative. These results mean that the design presented here is a promising strategy to improve the performance of polymers used in OSCs. © 2022 by the authors.","benzodithiophene; benzotriazole; fluorescein; FRET; organic solar cells; π-Conjugated polymers","Fluorescein; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Polymers; Solar Energy; Thiophenes; benzotriazole derivative; chloroform; dibenzothiophene derivative; fluorescein derivative; hexane; methanol; octanol; polymer; benzotriazole; fluorescein; polymer; thiophene derivative; absorption spectroscopy; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; conjugation; controlled study; current density; cyclic voltammetry; esterification; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; forster resonance energy transfer; measurement; molecular weight; polymerization; precipitation; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum chemistry; short circuit current; solubility; Soxhlet extraction; spectrofluorometry; thermostability; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; solar energy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141602324"

The fact that it is a memory-based method, i.e., it uses the entire training data set for prediction, makes it unsuitable for most current big data applications. Several strategies, such as tree-based or hashing-based estimators, have been proposed to improve the efficiency of the kernel density estimation method. The novel density kernel density estimation method (DMKDE) uses density matrices, a quantum mechanical formalism, and random Fourier features, an explicit kernel approximation, to produce density estimates. This method has its roots in the KDE and can be considered as an approximation method, without its memory-based restriction. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the novel DMKDE algorithm and compare it with other state-of-the-art fast procedures for approximating the kernel density estimation method on different synthetic data sets. Our experimental results show that DMKDE is on par with its competitors for computing density estimates and advantages are shown when performed on high-dimensional data. We have made all the code available as an open source software repository. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Approximations of kernel density estimation; Density matrix; Kernel density estimation; Quantum machine learning; Random fourier features","Clustering algorithms; Fourier transforms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Open systems; Quantum theory; Statistics; Approximation of kernel density estimation; Density matrix; Fourier features; Kernel Density Estimation; Kernel Density Estimation methods; Machine-learning; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Random fourier feature; Open source software","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148695543"

The emphasis is mainly placed on the determination of complex patterns of interaction of two or four electrons in three centers (2e-3c, 4e-3c).

The increase in the number of new sulfonamide derivatives makes it necessary to study more rationally the chemical structure, because the solid forms often display different mechanical, thermal and physicochemical properties that can influence the bioavailability and stability of the drugs; consequently, the polymorphic structures are of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry because of their ability to modify the physical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The molecular interactions of these drugs in their crystal lattice are important for the stability of the crystals and polymorphism and for preparing composite complexes for optimizing the use of these drugs. In this work, the crystal structure of these drugs and crystal polymorphism is investigated. So, the crystal forms of antibiotics derivatives of the sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfachloropyridazine, and sulfacetamide are studied at the molecular and supramolecular level by using computational modeling approach at quantum mechanical level. The spectroscopic properties of these systems are also studied explaining assignments of previous experimental data. The results of DFT calculations reproduce the crystal structures of sulfonamides determined experimentally and the polymorphism in these molecules have been clarified. Likewise, the main intermolecular interactions in all crystal forms of these sulfonamides are H-bonds among the sulfonic and amino groups and SNH groups, and also some π-π interactions. Also, these 3-D periodical models allow the exploration of the intermolecular interactions included in the crystal structures and some of these interactions can alter the vibration modes of the molecules. Therefore, the use of these models can be useful for experimental spectroscopy studies where use actual crystal solids. © 2022, The Author(s).","DFT calculations; hydrogen bonds; infrared spectroscopy; polymorphism; Sulfonamides","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Hydrogen Bonding; Models, Molecular; Spectrum Analysis; Sulfonamides; Amides; Biochemistry; Calculations; Chemical stability; Crystal structure; Density functional theory; Infrared spectroscopy; Molecules; Physicochemical properties; Polymorphism; Quantum theory; Sulfur compounds; sulfacetamide; sulfachlorpyridazine; sulfadimidine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfonamide; antiinfective agent; sulfonamide; Crystal forms; Crystal polymorphism; Crystals structures; DFT calculation; First principle calculations; Infrared: spectroscopy; Intermolecular interactions; Property; Sulphonamides; Therapeutic agents; Article; computer model; crystal structure; density functional theory; drug conformation; drug structure; hydrogen bond; solid state; X ray powder diffraction; chemistry; molecular model; procedures; spectroscopy; Hydrogen bonds","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134731537"

We present (1) a new theorem that characterizes the availability of nontrivial factors in the universe of search of Pollard’s Rho. The running time of Pollard’s Rho is reduced to polynomial-time on a quantum model of computation so long as we use a certain set of functions for generating the sequence of numbers that compose the method’s universe of search. We also present (2) an expression of a quantum procedure that implements Pollard’s Rho. The characterization given by (1) has led us to the conclusion that Pollard’s Rho is a generalization of Shor’s algorithm, but one obstacle stands in the way of this fact: the set of functions for generating the sequence of numbers must have a closed-form formula so we can take advantage of quantum parallelism; the closed-form formulas we have so far found are dependent on the order of an element in the multiplicative group of integers modulo a composite, whose fast computation can currently only be done by Shor’s algorithm. However, the quantum version of Pollard’s Rho is still useful even with this limitation: when Shor’s algorithm fails to factor the composite but correctly computes the order of the chosen element in the group of integers modulo the composite, a quantum version of Pollard’s Rho can use that order to try to factor the composite with an effective constant-factor faster runtime compared to running Shor’s algorithm a second time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Factoring; Order-finding; Period-finding; Pollard’s Rho; Quantum computing; Shor’s algorithm","Computation theory; Polynomial approximation; Quantum theory; Closed-form formulae; Factoring; Factoring integers; Integer modulo; Order-finding; Period-finding; Pollard’s rho; Quantum Computing; S-algorithms; Shor’s algorithm; Quantum computers","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148001983"

The most potent inhibitor (2a) shows the lowest binding free energy (–58.75 Kcal/mol) and more potency than Sinefungin (SFG) (–39.8 Kcal/mol), a pan-MTase inhibitor, which agrees with experimental observations. Besides, our results suggest that the total binding free energy of each evaluated SAM analog is driven by van der Waals interactions which can explain their poor cell permeability, as observed in experimental essays.

These protocols exploit the high dimensionality of structured light enabling the encoding of multiple bits of information in a single photon, the measurement of small physical parameters, and the achievement of unprecedented levels of security in schemes for cryptography. Unfortunately, the potential of structured light has been restrained to free-space platforms in which the spatial profile of photons is preserved. Here, we make an important step forward to using structured light for fiber optical communication. We introduce a classical encryption protocol in which the propagation of high-dimensional spatial modes in multimode fibers is used as a natural mechanism for encryption. This provides a secure communication channel for data transmission. The information encoded in spatial modes is retrieved using artificial neural networks, which are trained from the intensity distributions of experimentally detected spatial modes. Our on-fiber communication platform allows us to use single spatial modes for information encoding as well as the high-dimensional superposition modes for bit-by-bit and byte-by-byte encoding respectively. This protocol enables one to recover messages and images with almost perfect accuracy. Our classical smart protocol for high-dimensional encryption in optical fibers provides a platform that can be adapted to address increased per-photon information capacity at the quantum level, while maintaining the fidelity of information transfer.

Among these codes, there are the asymmetric ones, i.e., quantum codes whose Z-distance dz is different from its X-distance dx. The topological quantum codes form an important class of quantum codes, where the toric code, introduced by Kitaev, was the first family of this type. After Kitaev’s toric code, several authors focused attention on investigating its structure and the constructions of new families of topological quantum codes over Euclidean and hyperbolic surfaces. As a consequence of establishing the existence and the construction of asymmetric topological quantum codes in Theorem 5.1, the main result of this paper, we introduce the class of hyperbolic asymmetric codes. Hence, families of Euclidean and hyperbolic asymmetric topological quantum codes are presented. An analysis regarding the asymptotic behavior of their distances dx and dz and encoding rates k/n versus the compact orientable surface’s genus is provided due to the significant difference between the asymmetric distances dx and dz when compared with the corresponding parameters of topological codes generated by other tessellations. This inherent unequal error protection is associated with the nontrivial homological cycle of the { r, s} tessellation and its dual, which may be appropriately explored depending on the application, where r≠ s and (r- 2) (s- 2) ≥ 4. Three families of codes derived from the { 7 , 3 } , { 5 , 4 } , and { 10 , 5 } tessellations are highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asymmetric quantum codes; Hyperbolic codes; Surface codes; Topological quantum codes","Codes (symbols); Quantum noise; Topology; Asymmetric code; Asymmetric quantum codes; Asymptotic behaviour; Euclidean; Hyperbolic code; Hyperbolic surface; Quantum codes; Quantum error correcting codes; Surface code; Topological quantum code; Quantum computers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127958484"

Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology is one of the promising alternatives due to its higher switch speed, lower power dissipation, and higher device density. One of the most important and widely used circuits in digital logic calculations is the full adder (FA) circuit, which actually creates the problem of finding its optimal design and increasing performance. In this paper, we designed and implemented two new FA circuits in QCA technology and then implemented ripple carry adder (RCA) circuits. The proposed FAs and RCAs showed excellent performance in terms of QCA evaluation parameters, especially in cost and cost function, compared to the other reported designs. The proposed adders’ approach was 46.43% more efficient than the best-known design, and the reason for this superiority was due to the coplanar form, without crossovers and inverter gates in the designs. © 2022 by the authors.","coplanar; cost function; energy dissipation; full adder; quantum-dot cellular automata; ripple carry adder","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136827756"

The paper presents a novel family of linear, generative representations for evolving matrices. The matrices can be general or restricted within special classes of matrices like permutation matrices, Hermitian matrices, or other groups of matrices with particular algebraic properties. These classes include unitary matrices which encode quantum programs. This representation avoids the brittleness that arises in direct representations of matrices and permits the researcher substantial control of the part of matrix space being searched. The representation is demonstrated on a relatively simple matrix problem in automatic content generation as well as Boolean map induction and automatic quantum programming. The automatic content generation problem yields interesting results; the generative matrix representation yields worse fitness but a substantially greater variety of outcomes than a direct encoding, which is acceptable when generating content. The Boolean map experiments extend and confirm results that demonstrate that the generative encoding is superior to a direct encoding for the transition matrix of a Boolean map. The quantum programming results are generally quite good, with poor performance on the simplest problems in two of the families of programming tasks studied. The viability of the new representation for evolutionary matrix induction is well supported. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automatic content generation; Boolean networks; Evolutionary computation; Matrix representation; Quantum programs","Boolean algebra; Encoding (symbols); Fracture mechanics; Network coding; Quantum computers; Automatic content; Automatic content generation; Boolean Networks; Direct encoding; Linear representation; matrix; Matrix representation; Quantum program; Quantum programming; Simple++; Matrix algebra","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128068275"

The main characteristic of this algorithm is that it has peaks of diversity in its population, making it possible to escape from local minima effectively, avoiding stagnation. Through the proposed PSO, it is possible to obtain safe and efficient routes, avoiding energy waste and maintaining system integrity in several possible applications. The parameters of the proposed algorithm were tuned using the benchmarking functions. The same functions were used to compare the algorithm with those already established in the literature. Once the proposed algorithm showed promising results, it was simulated in four environments, each with different complexities, presenting dangerous regions and terrains unsuitable for robot navigation, and a large number of obstacles or even moving objects. Further, the algorithms used for comparison were also simulated and the EDPSO presented satisfactory results. Through simulations it was possible to notice that the proposed approach resulted in collision-free and planned routes, and the algorithm presented increased exploration features owing to the diversity peaks that occur during the optimization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomous vehicles; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Static and dynamic environments; Trajectory planning","Autonomous vehicles; Navigation; Robot programming; Robots; Swarm intelligence; Trajectories; A-particles; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Autonomous Vehicles; Mobile robotic; Optimisations; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Planning tasks; Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms; Static and dynamic environments; Trajectory Planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121906495"

In particular, building a reliable integrated source of entangled photons is one of the main challenges remaining for commercial exploitation in quantum sensing and metrology. Therefore, advances in design of integrated sources of entangled photons is a necessary and crucial task to be performed for miniaturization and cost-effectiveness. Microring resonators are one of the most promising candidates to generate entangled photons via nonlinear interactions, especially Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM). But fabrication limitations in reproducibility of high-quality resonators mandate the use of active devices. Here we present the results of preparing the excitation pulse with different spectral, intensity and dispersion parameters to optimize the quantum efficiency in passive devices after fabrication. Different numerical methods such as Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) and Split-Step Fourier Method (SSFM) are used to reproduce the nonlinear propagation, interplay with dispersion and losses. Exploiting the degree of freedom of the excitation pulse can bring more energy efficient and passive devices as quantum entangled pair sources in an integrated chip. Considerations on different degrees of entanglement are also discussed for applications in quantum sensing and quantum metrology. © 2023 SPIE.","Entangled Photons Sources; Four-Wave Mixing; Microring Resonators; Pulse Engineering; Pulse Shapping; Quantum Entanglement","Cost effectiveness; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dispersion (waves); Energy efficiency; Finite difference time domain method; Numerical methods; Optical resonators; Photons; Quantum entanglement; Entangled photon source; Entangled photons; Excitation pulse; Four-wave-mixing; Integrated sources; Microring resonator; Microrings; Photon sources; Pulse engineering; Pulse shapping; Four wave mixing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159781421"

There are different methods for addressing this problem but recently deep-neural density estimation methods have emerged as a powerful alternative. This paper presents a novel method for neural density estimation based on density matrices and adaptive Fourier features. Density matrices are commonly used in quantum mechanics to represent the quantum state of a physical system. In this work, they are used to estimate probability densities using an operation called quantum measurement. The proposed method can be trained without optimization using an averaging operation over the samples of the training dataset. It can also be integrated with deep learning architectures and trained using gradient descent. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a range of synthetic and real datasets and compared with fast kernel density estimation and state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance while being faster and more efficient than existing methods.  © 2013 IEEE.","adaptive Fourier features; Density estimation; density matrices; kernel density estimation; kernel methods; neural density estimation; quantum-inspired machine learning; random Fourier features","Deep learning; Density functional theory; Fourier transforms; Matrix algebra; Probability distributions; Quantum theory; Statistics; Adaptive fourier feature; Complexity theory; Computational modelling; Density estimation; Density matrix; Density measurement; Fourier features; Kernel; Kernel Density Estimation; Kernel-methods; Machine-learning; Neural density estimation; Parametric statistic; Quantum-inspired machine learning; Random fourier feature; Training data; Probability density function","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161057699"

In this study, the interaction of metal ions, namely, Cadmium Cd(II), Mercury Hg(II), and Lead Pb(II), on lignin matrices was investigated based on theoretical calculations. Binding energy (ΔEBind) values proved that the Pb(II) interacted better with lignin matrices than Cd(II) or Hg(II), having energy values between −8.4 kcal mol−1 to −20.2 kcal mol−1. The Gibbs energy (ΔG) and enthalpy (ΔH) values for Pb(II) were <0, indicating that the process was spontaneous and released heat. However, the lignin matrices studied in this work did not interact efficiently with Cd(II) and Hg(II) ions because almost all ΔEBind, ΔG, and ΔH values were positive. The bond length of the interaction proved that the Pb ions yielded the smallest values, ratifying the values for the interaction energy. Analyses based on the quantum theory of atoms in molecules showed that the interactions between Pb(II) and the matrices were partially covalent, whereas the interactions of Cd(II) and Hg(II) were predominantly electrostatic, justifying the positive values of ΔEBind, ΔG, and ΔH. The natural bond orbital results showed that the ligand orbitals of the matrix interacted with the lone pair antibonding orbital (LP*) of the metal ions. The theoretical results of the study show the possibility of applying lignin to remove heavy metal ions, especially Pb, and providing information for research related to wastewater treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Biopolymers; DFT; Metallic cations; Simulations; Wastewater treatment","Cadmium Compounds; Energy; Heavy Metals; Ions; Lead Compounds; Matrices; Simulation; Adsorption; Cadmium; Ions; Kinetics; Lead; Lignin; Mercury; Metals, Heavy; Binding energy; Bond length; Cadmium compounds; Computation theory; Heavy metals; Lead compounds; Lignin; Metal ions; Quantum theory; Wastewater treatment; cadmium; lead; lignin; mercury; metal ion; cadmium; heavy metal; ion; lead; lignin; Cadmiums (Cd); Computational studies; DFT; Environmental problems; Heavy metal ion; Lignin matrix; matrix; Metallic cations; Simulation; Waters resources; Article; chemical interaction; enthalpy; human; quantum theory; theoretical study; waste water management; adsorption; kinetics; Biopolymers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119620558"

In fact, reliability evaluations in GPUs and their internal units are of special interest by their high parallelism and to identify vulnerable structures. In particular, Special Function Unit (SFU) cores, inside GPUs, are highly used in multimedia, scientific computing, and the training of neural networks. However, reliability evaluations in SFUs have remained highly unexplored. This work evaluates the impact of transient faults in the hardware structures of SFUs for GPUs. We focus on evaluating and analyzing two SFU architectures ('fused' and 'modular') and their relations to energy, area, and reliability impact on GPU workloads. The evaluation resorts to a fine-grain analysis with experiments using an RTL open-source GPU (FlexGripPlus) instrumented with both SFUs. The experimental results on both SFU architectures indicate that modular SFUs are less vulnerable to transient faults (in up to 47% for the analyzed workloads) and are more power efficient (in up to 36.6%) but require additional cost in terms of area (about 27%) in comparison with a fused SFU architecture (base for commercial devices), which seems more vulnerable to faults, but is area efficient.  © 2023 IEEE.","Graphics Processing Units (GPUs); Reliability evaluation; Special Function unit (SFU); T-Stream core","Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Function evaluation; Network architecture; Program processors; Quantum computers; Safety engineering; Fault effect; Function unit; Graphic processing unit; Modulars; Recovery plans; Reliability Evaluation; Special function unit; Special functions; T-stream core; Transient faults; Graphics processing unit","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164708823"

Surface hopping is a general mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic dynamics methodology with many variants, such as fewest-switches surface-hopping, decoherence induced surface hopping, independent electron surface hopping, and others. The nuclei are propagated according to classical mechanics, and the forces on the nuclei, at any given instant of time, arise from a single adiabatic potential energy surfaces.

One obstacle is their non-constant execution time, since runtime variations can be exploited by side-channel attack techniques. We aim to create a constant-time approach to probabilistic algorithms, so cryptosystems can benefit from these algorithms’ efficiency, especially when considering larger parameters. Our countermeasure prevents that the execution time of a probabilistic root-finding algorithm be dependent on the degree of the input polynomial and makes it dependent only on the cryptosystem parameters. We compare the performance of our proposal to other root-finding algorithms already used in code-based cryptography and related works. We also show that our countermeasure can be applied to other root-finding algorithms successfully.

Crucially, the communication overhead introduced by the allotment process should be minimised—a key motivation behind the communication complexity problem (CCP). Quantum resources are well-suited to this task, offering clear strategies that can outperform classical counterparts. Furthermore, the connection between quantum CCPs and non-locality provides an information-theoretic insight into fundamental quantum mechanics. Here we connect quantum CCPs with a generalised non-locality framework—beyond Bell’s paradigmatic theorem—by incorporating the underlying causal structure, which governs the distributed task, into a so-called non-local hidden-variable model. We prove that a new class of communication complexity tasks can be associated with Bell-like inequalities, whose violation is both necessary and sufficient for a quantum gain.

The complete CRs are equalities involving quantum coherence, C, quantum entanglement, and predictability, P. While the first two are already quantified in the resource theory framework, such a characterization lacks for the last. In this article, we start showing that, for a system prepared in a state ρ, P of ρ, with reference to an observable X, is equal to C, with reference to observables mutually unbiased (MU) to X, of the state Φ X(ρ) , which is obtained from a non-revealing von Neumann measurement (NRvNM) of X. We also show that PX(ρ) > CY(Φ X(ρ)) for observables X, Y not MU. Afterwards, we provide quantum circuits for implementing NRvNMs and use these circuits to experimentally test these (in)equalities using the IBM’s quantum computers. Furthermore, we give a resource theory for predictability, identifying its free quantum states and free quantum operations and discussing some predictability monotones. Besides, after applying one of these predictability monotones to study bipartite systems, we discuss the relation among the resource theories of quantum coherence, predictability, and purity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Complementarity relations; Predictability; Quantum coherence; Resource theory","Quantum optics; Qubits; Basic rules; Complementarity relations; Measurements of; Predictability; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum coherence; Quantum resources; Resource theory; Von Neumann measurement; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130393987"

To show that a quantum-walk-based search is more efficient than a random-walk-based search is a difficult problem, which has been addressed in several ways. Usually, graph symmetries aid in the calculation of the algorithm’s computational complexity, and Johnson graphs are an interesting class regarding symmetries because they are regular, Hamilton-connected, vertex- and distance-transitive. In this work, we show that spatial search on Johnson graphs by continuous-time quantum walk achieves the Grover lower bound πN/2 with success probability 1 asymptotically for every fixed diameter, where N is the number of vertices.

VASP, one of the mostly used packages for density-functional calculations, provides local electronic structure either by projecting the electronic wave functions on atomic spheres, or as a band-decomposed partial charge density. Here, we present a simple tool which takes the partial charge density and the energy eigenvalues calculated by VASP as input and constructs local charge and spin densities. The new data provides a much better spatial understanding than the projection on the atomic spheres. It can be visualized directly in the real space e.g. with Vesta, or averaged along planes spanned by two of the lattice vectors of the periodic unit cell. The plane-averaged local (spin) density of states can be easily plotted e.g. as color-coded data using almost any plotting program. DensityTool can be applied to visualize and understand the local electronic structure of any system calculated with VASP. We expect it to be useful especially for researchers concerned with inhomogeneous systems, such as interfaces, defects, surfaces, adsorbed molecules, or hybrid inorganic-organic composites. Program summary: Program Title: DensityTool CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/26mcg4jwvd.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/llodeiro/DensityTool Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: FORTRAN Supplementary material: A complementary User Manual and examples can be found in the developer's repository link. Nature of problem: Total and local density of states (LDOS) are widely-used quantities for understanding the electronic structure of condensed matter. In VASP, one of the mostly used packages for numerically solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory, one does not directly obtain the LDOS. Usually, one works with partial density of states (PDOS), where the wave function is projected onto atomic orbitals. Alternatively, it is possible to calculate the band- and wavevector-dependent charge densities. Together with the band structure, LDOS can be obtained using post-processing tools. Solution method: DensityTool combines the band structure with band- and wavevector-dependent charge densities calculated by VASP to construct LDOS. In addition, spin-resolved LDOS (LSDOS) can be calculated for magnetic systems. Thus obtained LDOS and LSDOS can be further processed with DensityTool. In particular, it can be averaged along chosen spatial directions, which is convenient for example to demonstrate the spatially-resolved electronic structure of inhomogeneous systems. DensityTool can handle all three types of approaches implemented in VASP (non-magnetic, collinear magnetic, non-collinear magnetic including spin-orbit coupling), as well as all types of self-consistent band calculations as DFT (e.g., LDA, GGA, mGGA, BJ, and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals) and HF. For convenience, the output of DensityTool follows the format of VASP (the CHGCAR file), which can be easily used in other programs for visualization. We provide a sample python script to plot averaged L(S)DOS from the calculated data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electronic structure; FORTRAN; Local density of states; VASP","Atoms; Band structure; Charge density; Density functional theory; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; FORTRAN (programming language); HTTP; Momentum; Open source software; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Vector spaces; Wave functions; Atomic sphere; Densities of state; Electronic.structure; Inhomogeneous system; Local density of state; Local electronic structures; Partial charges; Post-processing; Processing tools; VASP; Electronic structure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129362587"

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a competitive clean energy emerging technology and will undoubtedly have a market niche in a world that needs to take advantage of every possible type of renewable energy. Recent studies have brought relevant improvements on internal efficiency, focusing on two properties at the interface: energetic disorder and bending. However, how positional disorder affects internal efficiency is still an open question. Here, we show that positional disorder is desired at the interface, but only up to a threshold value of 0.2 nm for poly p-phenylene vinylene. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, we realized that not enough excitons were reaching the interface, and introduced the Beer-Lambert law of attenuance to correct it. Furthermore, we realized that the same disorder that facilitates charge separation at the interface diminishes exciton and charge mobility in bulk, so we propose here a new morphology for the active layer of OPVs. Our suggestion implicates in better overall performance, improving not just the internal but the overall cell efficiency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beer-Lambert law of attenuation; Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation; Organic photovoltaics; Positional disorder","Article; bulk density; computer model; computer simulation; electric current; electricity; Monte Carlo method; normal distribution; organic photovoltaic; quantum chemistry; relative humidity; renewable energy; solar energy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138702774"

Femtoscopy is a technique that makes it possible to obtain spatiotemporal information on particle production sources at the femtometer scale through measurements of two-hadron momentum correlation functions. These correlation functions also provide information on low-energy hadron-hadron forces as final-state effects. In particular, such correlation functions give access to the forward scattering amplitude. One can express the forward amplitude as the product of the J/ψ chromopolarizability and the nucleon’s average chromoelectric gluon distribution, the latter being relevant to the problem of the origin of the nucleon mass. I will present the results of a recent study using the information on the J/ψ-nucleon interaction from lattice QCD simulations to compute J/ψ-nucleon correlation functions. The calculated correlation functions show clear sensitivity to the final-state interaction. I conclude discussing open issues regarding the use of the effective range expansion formula to fit experimental data for small scattering lengths and large effective range parameters. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","","Colliding beam accelerators; Cost effectiveness; Forward scattering; Heavy ions; Quantum theory; Correlation function; Effective range; Heavy-ion collisions; High energy proton; Learn+; Lower energies; Measurements of; Momentum correlation; Particle production; Spatiotemporal information; Hadrons","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161060407"

However, the qubit codified in path DoF often plays a limited role in the circuits. In this work, we present a linear optical circuit to codify qubits in path on different bases. We also present geometrical representations for path DoF as Poincaré-like sphere and the Bloch sphere for path qubit. In addition, we designed linear optical circuits to construct universal quantum gates for photonic propagation path DoF. The well-known analogy between degrees of freedom of a coherent laser beam and quantum systems is explored to experimentally simulate the preparation of the qubits as well as the implementation of the proposed circuit for the quantum gates.

From a practical perspective, this paper focuses on the feasibility of implementing a quantum-secure lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism in a SM, hardware-constrained equipment. In this regard, the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) scheme, FrodoKEM, an alternate candidate for the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum standardization process, is implemented using a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) device in which the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) component is exploited to accelerate the most time-consuming routines in this scheme. Experimental results show that the execution time to run the FrodoKEM scheme in an SoC device reduces to one-third of that obtained by the benchmark implementation (i.e., the software implementation). Also, the attained execution time and hardware resource usage of this SoC-based implementation of the FrodoKEM scheme show that lattice-based cryptography may fit into SM equipment. © 2022 by the authors.","post-quantum cryptography; smart grid; smart meter; system-on-a-chip","Application specific integrated circuits; Computer hardware; Electric power transmission networks; Hardware security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Smart meters; Smart power grids; System-on-chip; Chip implementation; Cryptographic schemes; Data-communication; Post quantum cryptography; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Smart grid; System on a chip; System-on-a-chip devices; Systems-on-a-chip; Programmable logic controllers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139926922"

Diagnosis is broadly applied in the context of rotating machines' state classification using several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. Recently, Quantum Computing (QC), a new and expanding research field, has contributed to different purposes and contexts, such as optimization, artificial intelligence, simulation, cybersecurity, pharmaceutics, and the energy sector. Despite the current limitations in terms of hardware, QC has been studied as an alternative for improving models' speed and computational efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) approach to diagnose rolling bearings, which are essential components in rotating machinery, based on vibration signals. We apply hybrid models involving the encoding and construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) connected to a classical neural network, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). We consider combinations of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) framework with rotation gates and different entanglement (two-qubits) gates (CNOT, CZ and iSWAP). For each PQC configuration, we assess the impact of the number of layers (1, 5 and 10). We use two databases of different complexity levels not previously explored with QML, namely CWRU and JNU, with 10 and 12 failure modes, respectivel. For CWRU, all QML models presented higher accuracy than the classical MLP. For JNU, all QML models were superior to classical MLP as well. These results suggest that, despite the current limitations of quantum environments, QML models are promising tools to be further investigated in PHM.  © 2013 IEEE.","fault diagnosis; prognostic and health management; Quantum machine learning; vibration signal","Computational efficiency; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Computational modelling; Faults diagnosis; Machine-learning; Prognostic and health management; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Vibration signal; Rotating machinery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149828336"

These setups induced a quantitative association of interferometric visibility (IVI) with the wave aspect of a single quantum system (WAQ). Recently, it was realized that quantum coherence (QC) can be better suited than IVI for quantifying the WAQ in complementarity relations. In this article, we investigate a MZI with biased beam splitters both in the input and in the output, and we show that in some cases the IVI is not adequate to quantify the WAQ since it does not reflect the behavior of the quantum coherence, even for a bi-dimensional closed quantum system.

Hence, it is not immediately clear whether tools and frameworks that capture the properties of thermodynamic phase transitions also apply in the quantum case. Concerning the crossing of thermodynamic critical points and describing its non-equilibrium dynamics, the Kibble–Zurek mechanism and linear response theory have been demonstrated to be among the very successful approaches. In the present work, we show that these two approaches are also consistent in the description of quantum phase transitions, and that linear response theory can even inform arguments of the Kibble–Zurek mechanism. In particular, we show that the relaxation time provided by linear response theory gives a rigorous argument for why to identify the “gap” as a relaxation rate, and we verify that the excess work computed from linear response theory exhibits Kibble–Zurek scaling. © 2022 by the authors.

In our case, this adjoint is defined through a J-metric, where the matrix J is a fundamental symmetry of Mn(C). In our paper, for quantum operators, we include the general setting in the which, these operators map J1-states into J2-states, where J2≠ ± J1 are two arbitrary fundamental symmetries.

Researchers have proposed new algorithms to address the neural architecture search (NAS) problem, including efforts to reduce the high computational cost of such methods. A common approach to improve efficiency is to reduce the search space with the help of expert knowledge, searching for cells rather than entire networks. Motivated by the faster convergence promoted by quantum-inspired evolutionary methods, the Q-NAS algorithm was proposed to address the NAS problem without relying on cell search. In this work, we consolidate Q-NAS, adding a new penalization feature, enhancing its retraining scheme, and also investigating more challenging search spaces than before. In CIFAR-10, we reached 93.85% of test accuracy in 67 GPU days, considering the addition of an early-stopping mechanism. We also applied Q-NAS to CIFAR-100, without modifying the parameters, and our best accuracy was 74.23%, which is comparable to ResNet164. The enhancements and results presented in this work show that Q-NAS can automatically generate network architectures that outperform hand-designed models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Also, compared to other NAS methods, Q-NAS results are promising regarding the balance between performance, runtime efficiency, and automation. We believe that our results enrich the discussion on this balance, considering alternatives to the cell search approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Neural architecture search; Quantum-inspired algorithms","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Network architecture; Cell search; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Machine learning models; Neural architecture search; Neural architectures; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Quantum-inspired algorithm; Search problem; Search spaces; Image recognition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126619451"

One of the most interesting qualities is that we can use quaternions to carry out rotations and operate on other quaternions; this characteristic of the quaternions inspired us to investigate how the quantum states and quantum operator work in the field of quaternions and how we can use it to construct a quantum neural network. This new type of quantum neural network (QNN) is developed in the quaternion algebra framework that is isomorphic to the rotor algebra G3+ of the geometric algebra and is based on the so-called qubit neuron model.

There are several flip flop designs proposed in the literature with their realization in the QCA technology. However, the majority of these designs suffer from large cell counts, large area utilization, and latency, which leads to the high cost of the circuits. To address this, this work performed a literature survey of the D flip flop (DFF) designs and complex sequential circuits that can be designed from it. A new design of D flip flop was proposed in this work and to assess the performance of the proposed QCA design, an in-depth comparison with existing designs was performed. Further, sequential circuits such as parallel-in-parallel-out (PIPO) and serial-in-parallel-out (SIPO) shift registers were designed using the flip flop design that was put forward. A comprehensive evaluation of the energy dissipation of all presented fundamental flip-flop circuits and other sequential circuits was also performed using the QCAPro tool, and their energy dissipation maps were also obtained. The suggested designs showed lower power dissipation and were cost-efficient, making them suitable for designing higher-power circuits. © 2022 by the authors.","cost function; energy dissipation; flip flop; quantum dots; quantum-dot cellular automata; shift register","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139946860"

The method exhibits a favorable scaling in the number of qubits compared to other estimation schemes. The use of separable bases makes our estimation method particularly well suited for applications in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, where entangling gates are much less accurate than local gates. Our method is also capable of estimating the purity of mixed states generated by the action of white noise on pure states. Monte Carlo simulations show that the method achieves a high estimation fidelity. Besides, the fidelity can be improved by increasing m above 2. We experimentally demonstrate the method on the IBM’s quantum processors by estimating up to 10-qubit separable and entangled states. In particular, a 4-qubit GHZ is estimated with experimental fidelity of 0.875. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Quantum entanglement; White noise; Estimation methods; Estimation schemes; Mixed state; N qubits; Projective measurement; Pure-state estimation; Quanta computers; Qubit state; Scalings; State estimation methods; Qubits","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130095739"

It also allowed for the achievement of empirically unattainable quantities such as Potential Energy Surfaces (PES), a fundamental construct in various applications, such as the study of weakly bound systems. One of DFT’s current weaknesses is a reliable description of PESs, due to a lack of suitable exchange-correlation functionals. In general, other post-Hartree-Fock methods are employed, such as n th-order Møller-Plesset’s Perturbation Theory (MPn) or Coupled Cluster Theory (CCSD(T)) with large basis sets. Despite producing good results, these methods demand much computational power when applied to large systems. This work presents a novel approach of PES description of the H2O2–Kr system using DFT by optimizing a long-range parameter present in some DFT functionals, obtaining results similar to those of the MPn methods with somewhat less computational time necessary.

As a consequence of measurement and noisy operations, some algorithms need to reinitialize the prepared state several times during its execution. If the quantum state preparation is not efficient, the quantum state preparation cost can dominate the computational cost of an algorithm. In this work, we propose a quantum state preparation algorithm, called CVO-QRAM algorithm, whose computational cost depends on the number of nonzero probability amplitudes and the maximum number of bits with a value of 1 in one of the patterns to be stored.

Despite the potential advantages of this technology, QCA circuits are frequently plagued by numerous forms of manufacturing faults (such as a missing cell, extra cell, displacement cell, and rotated cell), making them prone to failure. As a result, in QCA technology, the design of reversible circuits has received much attention. Reversible circuits are resistant to many kinds of faults due to their inherent properties and have the possibility of data reversibility, which is important. Therefore, this research proposes a new reversible gate, followed by a new 3 × 3 reversible gate. The proposed structure does not need rotated cells and only uses one layer, increasing the design’s manufacturability. QCADesigner-E and the Euler method on coherence vector (w/energy) are employed to simulate the proposed structure. The 3 × 3 reversible circuit consists of 21 cells that take up just 0.046 µm2. Compared to the existing QCA-based single-layer reversible circuit, the proposed reversible circuit minimizes cell count, area, and delay. Furthermore, the energy consumption is studied, confirming the optimal energy consumption pattern in the proposed circuit. The proposed reversible 3 × 3 circuit dissipates average energy of 1.36 (eV) and overall energy of 1.49 (eV). Finally, the quantum cost for implementing the reversible circuits indicates a lower value than that of all the other examined circuits. © 2022 by the authors.","nano-electronic; optimization; QCADesigner-E; quantum cost; quantum-dot; reversible logic","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143692611"

It was found that the double well potential (DWP) in He clusters is symmetrical and that the first layer of He atoms is able to model the system. The calculated tunneling splitting was in good agreement with the experimental, 36.4 and 24.6 cm- 1 respectively. For NH3 in Ar clusters, the DWP becomes slightly asymmetric, which is enough to decrease the resonance and make the symmetric DWP unable to model the system. An asymmetric potential was used and the result was in excellent agreement with the experimental splitting, of 9.0 and 10.6 cm- 1 respectively. Non-covalent interactions revealed that the asymmetry is caused by dissimilar interactions in each minimum of the double well potential. The effects of different methodologies were analyzed via a design of experiments approach. For the gas-phase NH3 molecule, only diffuse functions were statistically significant while for the NH3 embedded in He cluster both the MP2 method and polarization functions were significant. This tendency suggests higher order polarization functions may be essential to generate accurate barrier heights. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonia; DFT; Factorial design; MP2; Noble gas cluster; Quantum tunneling","ammonia; inert gas; Article; cold stress; computer model; controlled study; density functional theory; evaluation study; experimental design; factorial design; normal distribution; polarization; probability; statistical significance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137163586"

Besides, DESs have received much prominence due to their diverse applications: Electrodeposition of metals, organic synthesis, gas adsorption, and biodiesel production. Therefore, this work analyzed the effect of the temperature increase (298 K–353 K) on the behavior of the Co2+ ions in three eutectic solvents through electrochemical techniques and computational simulations. From the electrochemical analysis realized, the increase in temperature caused a reduction in specific mass and an increase in the diffusion coefficient. Besides, the activation energy values were of 15.3, 29.9, and 55.2 kJ mol−1 for 1ChCl:2 EG, 1ChCl:2U, and 1ChCl:2G, respectively. The computational simulations indicate that the increased temperature effect caused the replacement of HBD molecules by anions chloride around Co2+ ions for the SDW1 and SDW3 systems between the temperatures of 298 K–353 K, except for the SDW2 system that the replaced occurred in the interval of 313 K–353 K. Besides, the increase of temperature occasioned the increase of strength for Co–Cl interaction and weakened the interactions between the Co2+ ions with the oxygen of HBD molecules. © 2022","Cobalt; Computational simulations; Deep eutectic solvents; Electrochemical techniques","Anions; Ionic Liquids; Metals; Solvents; Activation energy; Biodiesel; Chlorine compounds; Eutectics; Gas adsorption; Ionic liquids; Ions; Molecules; Solvents; biodiesel; chloride; choline; cobalt; deep eutectic solvent; ethylene glycol; glycerol; urea; anion; ionic liquid; metal; solvent; Biodiesel production; Computational simulation; Deep eutectic solvents; Diverse applications; Electrochemical investigations; Electrochemical techniques; Metalorganics; Organic synthesis; Temperature increase; Theoretical investigations; Article; biofuel production; chronoamperometry; computer simulation; crystal structure; cyclic voltammetry; density functional theory; diffusion coefficient; electrochemical analysis; quantum mechanics; temperature sensitivity; Cobalt","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123176958"

PAOFLOW, is a software tool that constructs tight-binding Hamiltonians from self-consistent electronic wavefunctions by projecting onto a set of atomic orbitals. The electronic structure provides numerous materials properties that otherwise would have to be calculated via phenomenological models. In this paper, we describe recent re-design of the code as well as the new features and improvements in performance. In particular, we have implemented symmetry operations for unfolding equivalent k-points, which drastically reduces the runtime requirements of first principles calculations, and we have provided internal routines of projections onto atomic orbitals enabling generation of real space atomic orbitals. Moreover, we have included models for non-constant relaxation time in electronic transport calculations, doubling the real space dimensions of the Hamiltonian as well as the construction of Hamiltonians directly from analytical models. Importantly, PAOFLOW has been now converted into a Python package, and is streamlined for use directly within other Python codes. The new object oriented design treats PAOFLOW's computational routines as class methods, providing an API for explicit control of each calculation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ab initio tight-binding; DFT; Electronic structure; High-throughput calculations","Atoms; Design for testability; Electronic structure; Hamiltonians; High level languages; Object oriented programming; Quantum chemistry; Software design; Ab initio tight-binding; Advanced modeling; Atomic orbital; DFT; Electronic.structure; High-throughput calculation; Material science; Property; Real-space; Recent researches; Calculations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114128819"

From a mathematical point of view we use a technique of selfadjoint extensions applied to a symmetric differential operator with a domain containing smooth functions which vanish at two inner points of the real line. As is well known, the latter leads to a two-point boundary problem. We compute the resolvent of the corresponding extension and investigate its behavior in the case in which the inner points change their positions. The domain of these extensions can contain some functions with non differentiability or discontinuity at the points mentioned before. This fact can be interpreted as a presence of singular potentials like shifted Dirac delta functions and/or their first derivative centered at the same points. Then, we study the existence of broken-symmetry bound states. For some given entanglement boundary conditions we can show the existence of a ground state, which leads to a spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also prove that within a frame of Pontryagin spaces this type of symmetry breaking is saved if the distance between the mentioned above interior points tends to zero and then we can reformulate this result in terms of a larger Hilbert space. © 2021 South Ural State University.

The Gibbs free energy for the reduction of the putative P2X4R Zn(II) binding site by glutathione was estimated at −22 kcal/mol. Simulations of the WT P2X4R head domain revealed a flexible coordination sphere dominated by an octahedral geometry encompassing C126, N127, C132, C149, C159 and a water molecule. The C132A mutation disrupted the metal binding site, leading to a coordination sphere with a majority of water ligands, and a displacement of the metal ion towards the solvent. The C132A/C159A mutant exhibited a tendency towards WT-like stability by incorporating the R148 backbone to the coordination sphere. Thus, the computational findings agree with previous experimental data showing Zn(II) modulation for the WT and C132A/C159A variants, but not for the C132A mutant.

This representation facilitates the manipulation of signals by providing a flexible block size to store signal elements. Furthermore, QBRBS uses quantum superposition and entangled qubits to store signal values on the basis states of qubit registers instead of probability amplitude, enabling accurate information retrieval after finite measurements. A detailed analysis exposed a polynomial growth in qubit complexity and decreased quantum complexity on the presented quantum block format. The geometric, statistical, element-value, element-value block, and block position operations are described. Simulation experiments show the feasibility and capabilities of the block representation to achieve data hiding applications. A quantum steganography scheme exploiting the QBRBS features is presented. Finally, the quantum circuit and simulation verification are performed using Qiskit.  © 2022 IEEE.","block operations; quantum basis states format; quantum block representation; quantum steganography","Quantum entanglement; Steganography; Block operations; Block representation; Block sizes; Flexible blocks; Generalisation; Quantum base state format; Quantum block representation; Quantum entangled; Quantum steganography; Quantum superpositions; Qubits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143626466"

We have described a use case of molecular simulation and optimization using variational quantum eigen solver. The quantum generative model that we describe has several important use cases in which we discuss the generation of probability distributions, drugs, and option pricing for financial application. Various applications and their impact evaluations have been reviewed to determine if the use of quantum generator algorithms is more appropriate than traditional machine learning methods.

This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches.

By making use of BLAS operations, we propose, implement and analyze a quantum k-means (qk-means) algorithm with a low time complexity of O(NK log(D)I/C) to apply it to the fundamental problem of discriminating quantum states at readout. Discriminating quantum states allows the identification of quantum states |0〉 and |1〉 from low-level in-phase and quadrature signal (IQ) data, and can be done using custom ML models. In order to reduce dependency on a classical computer, we use the qk-means to perform state discrimination on the IBMQ Bogota device and managed to find assignment fidelities of up to 98.7% that were only marginally lower than that of the k-means algorithm. We also performed a cross-talk benchmark on the quantum device by applying both algorithms to perform state discrimination on a combination of quantum states and using Pearson Correlation coefficients and assignment fidelities of discrimination results to conclude on the presence of cross-talk on qubits. Evidence shows cross-talk in the (1, 2) and (2, 3) neighboring qubit couples for the analyzed device.  © 2021 IEEE.","Crosstalk; K-Means; Machine Learning; QK-Means; Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning","Correlation methods; Crosstalk; K-means clustering; Matrix algebra; Quantum optics; Cross talks; K-means; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; QK-mean; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum state; Machine learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128618100"

We first formulate the problem as a set of constraints represented in propositional logic and then resort to the SATyrus approach to convert the set of constraints to an energy minimization problem. Next, we transform the formulation to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO) and solve the problem using different approaches: (a) classical QUBO using simulated annealing in a von Neumann machine, (b) QUBO in a simulated quantum environment, (c) QUBO using the D-Wave quantum machine. Moreover, we study the amount of time and execution time reduction we can achieve by exploring approximate solutions using the three approaches. Results show that for every graph size tested with the number of nodes less than or equal to 7, we can always obtain at least one optimal solution. In addition, the D-Wave machine can find optimal solutions more often than its classical counterpart for the same number of iterations and number of repetitions. Execution times, however, can be some orders of magnitude higher than the classical or simulated approaches for small graphs. For a higher number of nodes, the average execution time to find the first optimal solution in the quantum machine is 26% (n= 6) and 47% (n= 7) better than the classical. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adiabatic quantum computation; Applications; Constraint and logic programming; Pseudo-Boolean optimization; Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization","Computer circuits; Formal logic; Logic programming; Mapping; Quantum computers; Simulated annealing; Adiabatic quantum computation; Binary optimization; Constraint programming; Logic-programming; Optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Pseudo-Boolean optimization; Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization; Quantum machines; Traveling salesperson problem; Optimal systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119322613"

Model simulations with limited electron-nuclear interactions have been conducted on classical devices resulting in experimentally verified final state results, however these simulations become too complex to simulate as the systems scale in size. This motivates us to propound the simulation of the relevant spin dynamics in a noisy quantum device to probe the currently unexplored open quantum systems aspects of the radical pair mechanism and to provide a novel theoretical tool for us to be able to tackle bottlenecks in simulating larger and more physically relevant biological spin systems. We employ a hybrid quantum machine learning approach where we evaluate a parametrized quantum circuit representing the evolution of the system on the quantum device and then update the parameters according to our objective cost function on a classical computer using a gradient optimizer and a noisy gradient free (SPSA) optimizer. We show that a 3 qubit circuit with a series of parametrized rotation gates representing the Hyperfine and Zeeman interactions can be optimized, resulting in a circuit that evolves a singlet state under different magnetic field angles. Moreover, we show that the noisy gradient free optimizer is better suited for optimizing on a noisy quantum device. However, the precision in the quantum circuit outputs is only sub-par at present, leaving room for further improvements.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Bioinformatics; Cost functions; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Magnetic fields; Optimization; Quantum optics; Biological mechanisms; Chemistry simulations; Machine-learning; Magnetic-field; Modeling simulation; Optimizers; Quantum circuit; Quantum device; Quantum machines; Radical pair mechanism; Spin dynamics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143628139"

Recent advances in sampling algorithms for alchemical free energy calculations and the increase in computational power have made their binding affinity prediction primarily dependent on the quality of the force field. Here, we propose a new methodology to derive the atomic charges of host-guest systems based on quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations and minimal basis iterative stockholder (MBIS) partitioning of the polarized electron density. A newly developed interface between the OpenMM and ORCA software packages provides D-MBIS charges that represent the guest’s average electrostatic interactions in the hosts or the solvent. The simulation workflow also calculates the average energy required to polarize the guest in the bound and unbound state. Alchemical free energy calculations using the general Amber force field parameters with D-MBIS charges improve the binding affinity prediction of six guests bound to two octa acid hosts compared to the AM1-BCC charge set after correction with the average energetic polarization cost. This correction originates from the difference in potential energy that is required to polarize the guest in the bound and unbound state and contributes significantly to the binding affinity of anionic guests. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","Binding energy; Free energy; Iterative methods; Potential energy; Quantum theory; Atomic charge; Binding affinities; Bound-states; Free-energy calculations; Host/guest systems; Modelling systems; Molecular environment; Polaris; Stockholder charges; Unbound state; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115101397"

Among the different kinds of inhibitors of this kinase, the allosteric ones stand out due to their selective and subtle modulation, lowering the chance of producing side effects. The mechanism of GSK-3β allosteric modulators may be considered still vague in terms of elucidating a well-defined binding pocket and a bioactive pose for them. In this context, we propose to reinvestigate and reinforce such knowledge by the application of an extensive set of in silico methodologies, such as cavity detection, ligand 3D shape analysis and docking (with robust validation of corresponding protocols), and molecular dynamics. The results here obtained were consensually consistent in furnishing new structural data, in particular by providing a solid bioactive pose of one of the most representative GSK-3β allosteric modulators. We further applied this to the prospect for new compounds by ligand-based virtual screening and analyzed the potential of the two obtained virtual hits by quantum chemical calculations.

Although nowadays quantum algorithms performance has shown superior to their classical counterparts, quantum decoherence and additional auxiliary qubits needed for error tolerance routines have been huge barriers for quantum algorithms efficient use. These restrictions lead us to search for ways to minimize algorithms costs, i.e the number of quantum logical gates and the depth of the circuit. For this, quantum circuit synthesis and quantum circuit optimization techniques are explored. We studied the viability of using Projective Simulation, a reinforcement learning technique, to tackle the problem of quantum circuit synthesis for noise quantum computers with limited number of qubits. The agent had the task of creating quantum circuits up to 5 qubits to generate GHZ states in the IBM Tenerife (IBM QX4) quantum processor. Our simulations demonstrated that the agent had a good performance but its capacity for learning new circuits decreased as the number of qubits increased. © IBERAMIA and the authors.","Machine Learning; Projective Simulation; Quantum Circuit Synthesis; Reinforcement Learning","Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Reinforcement learning; Timing circuits; Auxiliary qubits; Classical counterpart; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum decoherence; Quantum processors; Reinforcement learning techniques; Microwave circuits","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104935962"

Because new chemical structures appear frequently and reliable reference data do not always exist, identifying these compounds is an operational problem. Theoretical chemistry associated with statistical methods has scarcely been used to tackle such problems and can provide an unvaluable aid. In this study, we have employed quantum chemistry tools to simulate NMR spectra and to evaluate, as a paradigm, the main differences between amphetamines and cathinones. We have generated and examined the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of 21 homologous amphetamine and cathinone structures. In our computational approach, we used a test set and a proof set to generate the shifted factors on the basis of experimental observations. We employed three different DFTs (B3LYP, M062X, and PBE0) with a TZVP basis set and different solvents (water, ethanol, chloroform, and gas-phase). To evaluate the data, we applied statistical approaches, which allowed us to assess the methods and to distinguish between the studied NPS. This study provided reliable information that helps to explain how NMR evaluation differs in assessing these molecules and promoting their discrimination in forensic analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Amphetamines; Cathinones; Chemometrics; DFT; NMR; PLS-DA","alcohol; amphetamine; cathinone; chloroform; water; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemometrics; computer model; controlled study; criminalistics; density functional theory; drug discrimination; drug structure; gas; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum chemistry; statistical analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100827589"

However, most QPL addresses the inherent quantum programming problem, neglecting quantum computer implementation constraints. We present a runtime architecture for classical-quantum execution that mitigates the limitation of interaction between classical and quantum computers originated from the cloud-based model of quantum computation provided by several vendors, which implies a quantum computer processing in batch. In the proposed runtime architecture, we introduce (i) runtime quantum code generation to enable generic quantum programming and dynamic quantum execution; and (ii) the concept of futures to handle dynamic interaction between classical and quantum computers. To support our proposal, we have implemented the Ket Quantum Programming framework that features a Python-embedded classical-quantum programming language named Ket, the C++ quantum programming library Libket, and Ket Bitwise (quantum computing) Simulator. The last one improves over the bitwise representation, making the simulation time not dependent on the number of qubits but the amount of superposition and entanglement of simulation.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Inspired by this paradigm, we consider superconducting architectures and extend the cross-resonance effect, up to first order in perturbation theory, from a two-qubit interaction to an analog Hamiltonian acting on one-dimensional (1D) chains and two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, which, in an appropriate reference frame, results in a purely two-local Hamiltonian. By augmenting the analog Hamiltonian dynamics with single-qubit gates we show how one may generate a larger variety of distinct analog Hamiltonians. We then synthesize unitary sequences, in which we toggle between the various analog Hamiltonians as needed, simulating the dynamics of Ising, XY, and Heisenberg spin models. Our dynamics simulations are Trotter error-free for the Ising and XY models in 1D. We also show that the Trotter errors for 2D XY and 1D Heisenberg chains are reduced, with respect to a digital decomposition, by a constant factor. In order to realize these important near-term speedups, we discuss the practical considerations needed to accurately characterize and calibrate our analog Hamiltonians for use in quantum simulations. We conclude with a discussion of how the Hamiltonian toggling techniques could be extended to derive new analog Hamiltonians, which may be of use in more complex digital-analog quantum simulations for various models of interacting spins. © 2021 authors.

However, although various numerical optimization algorithms can be employed for determining the WPI most probable path, there is generally no guarantee that the selected algorithm converges to a global extremum. In this paper, first, a Newton's optimization scheme is proposed for determining the most probable path, and various convergence behavior aspects are elucidated. Second, the existence of a unique global minimum and the convexity of the objective function of the considered nonlinear system are demonstrated by resorting to computational algebraic geometry concepts and tools, such as Gröbner bases. Several numerical examples pertaining to diverse nonlinear oscillators are considered, where it is proved that the associated objective functions are convex, and that the proposed Newton's scheme converges to the globally optimum most probable path. Comparisons with pertinent Monte Carlo simulation data are included as well for demonstrating the reliability of the WPI technique. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Gröbner basis; Nonlinear systems; Numerical optimization; Path integral; Stochastic dynamics","Algebra; Biped locomotion; Computational geometry; Global optimization; Monte Carlo methods; Nonlinear systems; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Computational algebraic geometry; Convergence behaviors; Functional minimization; Non-linear oscillators; Numerical optimization algorithms; Objective functions; Probability density function (pdf); Solution treatments; Probability density function","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098712369"

However, obtaining this coordination can be challenging due to the quantity and characteristics of the agents, the dynamics of the environment and/or the complexity of the task, requiring much computation time. Furthermore, some problems require different types of agent specialization. In this case, it is very difficult for the programmers to define learning strategies and their parameters. Optimization of these parameters using standard evolutionary algorithms is also inadequate due to the high computational cost in these real multi-agent situations. The main objective of this study is therefore to propose a new neuroevolution model to be applied to agent coordination problems, termed the Quantum-Inspired Neuro Coevolution (QNCo) Model. QNCo makes use of paradigms from quantum physics and biological coevolution to evolve sub-populations of quantum individuals aiming convergence gains. The model has the capacity to autonomously obtain the best neural network topology of each agent, eliminating the need for the programmer to set this configuration. New quantum crossover and mutation operators were proposed and compared during function optimization of different dimensions. The proposed model was tested in two simulation problems, prey-predator and multi-rover tasks, and one real problem of mobile telephony coverage. The QNCo model yielded promising results compared to similar algorithms, with good solutions in terms of learning strategies and a great reduction in convergence time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coevolution; Coordination; Neuro-evolution; Quantum inspiration","Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Topology; Agent coordination; Computational costs; Coordination problems; Crossover and mutation; Function Optimization; Learning strategy; Neural network topology; Real-world problem; Autonomous agents","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096595429"

For this reason, it is important to have methodological tools that allow a detailed study of their activity and inhibition, combining computational efficiency and accuracy. We here explore the performance of different quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods to explore the inhibition reaction mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease with a hydroxymethyl ketone derivative. We selected two density functional theory (DFT) functionals (B3LYP and M06-2X), two semiempirical Hamiltonians (AM1d and PM6), and two tight-binding DFT methods (DFTB3 and GFN2-xTB) to explore the free energy landscape associated with this reaction. We show that it is possible to obtain an accurate description combining molecular dynamics simulations performed using tight-binding DFT methods and single-point energy corrections at a higher QM description. The use of a computational strategy that provides reliable results at a reasonable computational cost could assist the in silico screening of possible candidates during the design of new drugs directed against cysteine proteases.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131159793"

We present an alternative way of exploring this phenomenon by defining and computing a characteristic length scale, which possesses relevant characteristics to study the establishment of the quantum turbulent regime. We reconstruct the three-dimensional momentum distributions with the inverse Abel transform, as we have done successfully in other works. We present our analysis with both the two-and three-dimensional momentum distributions, discussing their similarities and differences.

Fortunately, density matrix renormalization group-based tools, which have been widely used in the study of closed systems, have also been recently extended to the treatment of open systems. We present an implementation of such method based on state-of-the-art matrix product state (MPS) and tensor network methods, that produces accurate results for a variety of combinations of parameters. Unlike most approaches, which use the time-evolution to reach the steady-state, we focus on an algorithm that is time-independent and focuses on recasting the problem in exactly the same language as the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm, initially put forward in [1]. Hence, it can be readily exported to any of the available DMRG platforms. We show that this implementation is suited for studying thermal transport in one-dimensional systems. As a case study, we focus on the XXZ quantum spin chain and benchmark our results by comparing the spin current and magnetization profiles with analytical results. We then explore beyond what can be computed analytically.

Besides, the latest advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools find helpful for decision-making in innovative healthcare to diagnose several diseases. Ovarian Cancer (OC) is a kind of cancer that affects women’s ovaries, and it is tedious to identify OC at the primary stages with a high mortality rate. The OC data produced by the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices can be utilized to differentiate OC. In this aspect, this paper introduces a new quantum black widow optimization with a machine learning-enabled decision support system (QBWO-MLDSS) for smart healthcare. The primary intention of the QBWO-MLDSS technique is to detect and categorize the OC rapidly and accurately. Besides, the QBWO-MLDSS model involves a Z-score normalization approach to pre-process the data. In addition, the QBWO-MLDSS technique derives a QBWO algorithm as a feature selection to derive optimum feature subsets. Moreover, symbiotic organisms search (SOS) with extreme learning machine (ELM) model is applied as a classifier for the detection and classification of ELM model, thereby improving the overall classification performance. The design of QBWO and SOS for OC detection and classification in the smart healthcare environment shows the study’s novelty. The experimental result analysis of the QBWO-MLDSS model is conducted using a benchmark dataset, and the comparative results reported the enhanced outcomes of the QBWO-MLDSS model over the recent approaches. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

We show that using the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation operator integral kernel the problem reduces to an infinite linear system of equations, which is uniquely solvable if so is the original problem. The solution of this linear system allows one to reconstruct the characteristic determinant and hence to obtain the eigenvalues as its zeros and to compute the corresponding norming constants. As a result, the original inverse problem is transformed to an inverse problem with a given spectral density function, for which the direct method of solution from Kravchenko and Torba (2021 Inverse Problems 37 015015) is applied. The proposed method leads to an efficient numerical algorithm for solving a variety of inverse problems. In particular, the problems in which two spectra or some parts of three or more spectra are given, the problems in which the eigenvalues depend on a variable boundary parameter (including spectral parameter dependent boundary conditions), problems with a partially known potential and partial inverse problems on quantum graphs.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Gelfand-Levitan equation; inverse spectral problem; Neumann series of Bessel functions; Sturm-Liouville spectral problem; transmutation operator; Weyl-Titchmarsh theory","Differential equations; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Fourier series; Linear systems; Numerical methods; Spectral density; Boundary parameters; Fourier-Legendre series; Integral kernel; Linear system of equations; Numerical algorithms; Practical method; Spectral parameters; Sturm-Liouville problem; Inverse problems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108585655"

Thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of these complexes have been evaluated by calculating the interaction energy of Ng atoms encapsulated C24N24 cage (ΔEint), and the corresponding dissociation energy barrier (ΔG‡), respectively. The obtained results predict that although these complexes are thermodynamically unstable compared to their dissociation into free Ng atoms and the bare C24N24 cage, but once formed, they are protected by the activation energy barrier of the corresponding dissociation process. Furthermore, natural population analysis (NPA) and topological analysis of the electron density have been employed to investigate the nature of Ng-Ng and Ng-cage interactions. The results demonstrate that these interactions are highly significant compared to similar cases in the free state; and the amounts of energy of the interaction gradually increases as the Ng atom becomes heavier.

Yet, it is intuitive that randomness should gradually deteriorate as the setup deviates from that ideal condition. In order to test whether this trend exists or not, we prepare biphotons with three different levels of entanglement: moderately entangled (S= 2.67), marginally entangled (S= 2.06), and non-entangled (S= 1.42) in a setup that mimics a practical situation. The indicators of randomness we use here are: a battery of standard statistical tests, Hurst exponent, an evaluator of Kolmogorov complexity, Takens’ dimension of embedding, and augmented Dickey–Fuller and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin to check stationarity. A nonparametrical statistical ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis) analysis reveals a strong influence of the level of entanglement with randomness when measured with Kolmogorov complexity in three time series with P-values and strength factor ϵ2: P= 0.0015 , ϵ2= 0.28 ; P= 4.5 × 10 - 4, ϵ2= 0.67 and P= 5.6 × 10 - 4, ϵ2= 0.16. The setup is pulsed with time stamping, what allows generate different series applying different methods with the same data, even after the experimental run has ended, and to compare their raw randomness. It also allows the stroboscopic reconstruction of time variation of entanglement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Entangled photons; Hurst exponent; Kolmogorov complexity","Computational complexity; Random number generation; Random processes; Time series analysis; Entangled state; Hurst exponents; Kolmogorov complexity; Random Numbers; Stationarity; Strength factor; Time variations; Timestamping; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105207782"

Like previous works, it uses a chameleon hash function—a special kind of hash function where it is possible to compute collisions efficiently if a trapdoor is known. One problem with most chameleon hash functions is that collision-resistance and security are invalidated or severely weakened if a collision is publicized. It turns out that redacting a blockchain in existing constructions reveals collisions. Previous works dealt with this using public-key encryption schemes and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs to achieve what is known as Enhanced or Full Collision-Resistance. Here instead, we propose a simpler and hopefully faster construction. We use a subset of chameleon hash schemes where the trapdoor also allows for first-preimage computation. We build a redactable blockchain using this stronger property where redactions do not expose collisions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Chameleon hash; Post-quantum cryptography; Redactable blockchain","Hash functions; Public key cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Block-chain; Chameleon hash; Collision resistance; Hash collisions; Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs; Post quantum cryptography; Public-key encryption scheme; Redactable blockchain; Simple++; Trusted authorities; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142757307"

Qubits, the primary computing elements of quantum circuits, exploit the quantum physics proprieties to increase the parallelism and speed of computation drastically. Unfortunately, besides being intrinsically noisy, qubits have also been shown to be highly susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. The latest discoveries highlight a much higher radiation sensitivity of qubits than traditional transistors and identify a much more complex fault model than bit-flip.We propose a framework to identify the quantum circuits sensitivity to radiation-induced faults and the probability for a fault in a qubit to propagate to the output. Based on the latest studies and radiation experiments performed on real quantum machines, we model the transient faults in a qubit as a phase shift with a parametrized magnitude. Additionally, our framework can inject multiple qubit faults, tuning the phase shift magnitude based on the proximity of the qubit to the particle strike location. As we show in the paper, the proposed fault injector is highly flexible, and it can be used on both quantum circuit simulators and real quantum machines. We report the finding of more than 285, 249, 536 injections on the Qiskit simulator and 53, 248 injections on real IBM machines. We consider three quantum algorithms and identify the faults and qubits that are more likely to impact the output. We also consider the fault propagation dependence on the circuit scale, showing that the reliability profile for some quantum algorithms is scale-dependent, with increased impact from radiation-induced faults as we increase the number of qubits. Finally, we also consider multi qubits faults, showing that they are much more critical than single faults. The fault injector and the data presented in this paper are available in a public repository to allow further analysis.  © 2022 IEEE.","Fault Injection; Fault Tolerance; Quantum Computing; Reliability Evaluation","Circuit simulation; Fault tolerance; Flexible electronics; Ionizing radiation; Quantum theory; Qubits; Software testing; Computation paradigms; Fault injection; Fault injector; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Qubit circuits; Radiation-induced; Reliability Evaluation; Timing circuits","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136322942"

Excellent outcomes have resulted from using this technique; however, the implementation of this approach remains computationally expensive to some extent. Novel computing technologies may help reducing the computational simulation time, particularly, by using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Calculations on GPUs make possible to carry out simulations of large and complex molecular systems at a significantly reduced time. In this manuscript, the implementations of measure-preserving geometric integrator in the canonical ensemble coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) language are presented. The performance and validation of our High-throughput Molecular Dynamics (HIMD) code was done by calculating the thermodynamic properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid. From our tested systems, an excellent agreement was achieved with the reported of literature, compared with calculations carried out on Central Processing Units (CPUs). The implementation of the HIMD code performs time integration on Nosé-Hoover chains (NHC) faster in comparison to the NHC method implemented in LAMMPS code tested with one CPU vs one GPU. Along this work, the scope and limitations in performing simulations by using our HIMD code under rigorous statistical thermodynamics in the canonical ensemble are discussed and analyzed. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Canonical Ensemble (NVT); Graphical Processing Units (GPUs); Molecular Dynamics (MD); Nosé-Hoover Chains (NHC)","Bioinformatics; Molecular dynamics; Program processors; Quantum theory; Statistical mechanics; Thermodynamic properties; Canonical ensemble; Canonical ensemble (NVT); Graphical processing unit; Graphical processing units; High-throughput; Liouville operator; Molecular dynamic; Nose-hoover chain; Soft condensed matters; Theoretical technique; Graphics processing unit","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128978468"

First, a small set of candidates has been selected from a large and stochastically generated (Kick) population according to the maximum value of the Coulombic integral between the Fukui functions of both fragments. Subsequently, these few candidates are optimized using a gradient method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The performance of the program has been evaluated to explore the PES of various systems, including atomic and molecular clusters. In most cases studied, the global minimum (GM) has been identified with a low computational cost.

Quantum memory can be used in many aspects, such as quantum computing and quantum communication. Continuous research and experiments have enabled quantum memory to realize the storage of qubits. On the other hand, interleaving techniques are used to deal with burst of errors. Many works from literature provide effective interleaving techniques for combating burst of errors by using classical error-correcting codes. However, to the best of our knowledge, little is known regarding interleaving techniques for combating cluster of errors in topological quantum error-correcting codes. Thenceforward, it is proposed in this work a new interleaving technique by using good toric quantum codes, namely Bombin and Martin-Delgado toric codes and another class of toric codes from literature which is described in this work. As a consequence, by applying this new interleaving method to such toric quantum codes, new quantum burst-error correcting codes are obtained which improve the coding gain. In addition to the proposed quantum interleaving technique improves such parameter, it can be used for burst-error correction in errors which are located, quantum data stored and quantum channels with memory. © 2022 IEEE.","polyomino; quantum burst-error cor-rection; quantum interleaving; square lattice; toric quantum codes","Digital storage; Error correction; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Qubits; Burst errors; Interleaving technique; Interleavings; Polyominoes; Quantum burst-error cor-rection; Quantum codes; Quantum interleaving; Quantum memory; Square lattices; Toric quantum code; Photons","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146962797"

These examples share a common trait—time evolution. A prominent QCD property impacted by a strong magnetic field is the quark condensate, an approximate order parameter of the QCD transition between a high-temperature quark-gluon phase and a low-temperature hadronic phase. We use the linear sigma model with quarks to address the quark condensate time evolution under a strong magnetic field. We use the closed time path formalism of nonequilibrium quantum field theory to integrate out the quarks and obtain a mean-field Langevin equation for the condensate. The Langevin equation features dissipation and noise kernels controlled by a damping coefficient. We compute the damping coefficient for magnetic field and temperature values achieved in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions and solve the Langevin equation for a temperature quench scenario. The magnetic field changes the dissipation and noise pattern by increasing the damping coefficient compared to the zero-field case. An increased damping coefficient increases fluctuations and time scales controlling condensate’s short-time evolution, a feature that can impact hadron formation at the QCD transition. The formalism developed here can be extended to include other order parameters, hydrodynamic modes, and system’s expansion to address magnetic field effects in complex settings as heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and magnetars. © 2021 by the authors.

This research work introduces the SCAPS software to model the CIGSe TFSC. From the simulated results, the solar cell performance was enhanced with an increase in thickness of the CIGSe by improving the absorption of photons. The recombination centers for the generated charge carriers were increased at higher carrier concentrations of the CIGSe. The efficiency was slightly improved when CdS thickness is increased from 20 to 100 nm. The collection of generated charge carriers was enhanced with a rise in carrier concentration of CdS, which increases the device performance. After analyzing these results, the optimized efficiency of 27.32% was noticed for CIGSe TFSC. The quantum efficiency (QE) results confirmed that the photons whose wavelength value lower than 900 nm are absorbed in the device. Moreover, the experimental results of CIGSe and CdS thin films are studied in this simulation. It was observed that the device's performance was reduced with an increase in the thickness of the CdS.

In most scenarios, the isogeny is known to be of degree ℓe for some small prime ℓ. We call this problem the Supersingular Fixed-Degree Isogeny Path (SIPFD) problem. It is believed that the most general version of SIPFD is not solvable faster than in exponential time by classical as well as quantum attackers. In a classical setting, a meet-in-the-middle algorithm is the fastest known strategy for solving the SIPFD. However, due to its stringent memory requirements, it quickly becomes infeasible for moderately large SIPFD instances. In a practical setting, one has therefore to resort to time-memory trade-offs to instantiate attacks on the SIPFD. This is particularly true for GPU platforms, which are inherently more memory-constrained than CPU architectures. In such a setting, a van Oorschot-Wiener-based collision finding algorithm offers a better asymptotic scaling. Finding the best algorithmic choice for solving instances under a fixed prime size, memory budget and computational platform remains so far an open problem. To answer this question, we present a precise estimation of the costs of both strategies considering most recent algorithmic improvements. As a second main contribution, we substantiate our estimations via optimized software implementations of both algorithms. In this context, we provide the first optimized GPU implementation of the van Oorschot-Wiener approach for solving the SIPFD. Based on practical measurements we extrapolate the running times for solving different-sized instances. Finally, we give estimates of the costs of computing a degree- 2 88 isogeny using our CUDA software library running on an NVIDIA A100 GPU server. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cryptanalysis; Efficient implementation; Golden collision search; GPU; Isogenies; Meet-in-the-middle; Time-memory trade-offs","Budget control; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Economic and social effects; Fixed platforms; Algorithmics; Computational hardness; Cryptanalyse; Efficient implementation; Golden collision search; Isogenie; Limited memory; Meet-in-the-middle; Path finding; Time-memory trade-offs; Graphics processing unit","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147847338"

In Shannon’s communication model, information is prepared at Alice’s side, and it is then intended to pass it over a noisy channel. In our approach, secret bits do not rely in Alice’s transmitted quantum bits but in Bob’s basis measurement choices. Therefore, measured bits are publicly revealed, while bases selections remain secret. Our method implements sifting, reconciliation, and amplification in a unique process, and it just requires a round iteration; no redundancy bits are sent, and there is no limit in the correctable error percentage. Moreover, this method can be implemented as a post-processing software into QKD technologies already in use. © 2020 by the authors.

Qiskit simulator is a platform developed by IBM that allows working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. The performance of HQGA is evaluated in three strongly correlated KP data sets, and computational results are compared with a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QIEA), a modified version of a QIEA (QIEA-Q), and a modified version of the HQGA (HQGA-Q). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HQGA can obtain the best solutions in all the KP data sets, and performs well on robustness. © 2022 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

Room-temperature implementation of CV cluster states has been achieved with quantum optics by using multimode squeezed Gaussian states. It has also been proven that fault tolerance thresholds for CV quantum computing can be reached at realistic squeezing levels. In this paper, we show that standard approaches to design and characterize CV cluster states can miss entanglement present in the system. Such hidden entanglement may be used to increase the power of a quantum computer but it can also, if undetected, hinder the successful implementation of a quantum algorithm. By a detailed analysis of the structure of Gaussian states, we derive an algorithm that reveals hidden entanglement in an arbitrary Gaussian state and optimizes its use for one-way quantum computing. © 2021 authors.

In the pursuit of that goal, our previous studies revealed that the essential conformational characteristics of the most populated “canonic” BI and AI conformational families of Watson–Crick duplexes, including the sequence dependence of their 3D structure, preexist in the local energy minima of the elemental single-chain fragments, deoxydinucleoside monophosphates (dDMPs). Those computations have uncovered important sequence-dependent regularity in the superposition of neighbor bases. The present work expands our studies to new minimal fragments of DNA with Watson–Crick nucleoside pairs that differ from canonic families in the torsion angles of the sugar-phosphate backbone (SPB). To address this objective, computations have been performed on dDMPs, cdDMPs (complementary dDMPs), and minimal fragments of SPBs of respective systems by using methods of molecular and quantum mechanics. These computations reveal that the conformations of dDMPs and cdDMPs having torsion angles of SPB corresponding to the local energy minima of separate minimal units of SPB exhibit sequence-dependent characteristics representative of canonic families. In contrast, conformations of dDMP and cdDMP with SPB torsions being far from the local minima of separate SPB units exhibit more complex sequence dependence. © 2021 by the authors.

These cryptosystems are currently used for the exchange of keys between servers and clients over the Internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next step in the evolution of the Internet, and it involves the connection of millions of low-powered and resource-constrained devices to the network. Because quantum computers are becoming more capable, the creation of a new cryptographic standard that cannot be compromised by them is indispensable. There are several current proposals of quantum-resistant or post-quantum algorithms that are being considered for future standards. Given that the IoT is increasing in popularity, and given its resource-constrained nature, it is worth adapting those new standards to IoT devices. In this work, we study some post-quantum cryptosystems that could be suitable for IoT devices, adapting them to work with current cryptography and communication software, and conduct a performance measurement on them, obtaining guidelines for selecting the best for different applications in resource-constrained hardware. Our results show that many of these algorithms can be efficiently executed in current IoT hardware, providing adequate protection from the attacks that quantum computers will eventually be capable of. © 2022 by the authors.

The protocol requires simple modulation and detection procedures with intensity modulation on a single quadrature and homodyne detection. The secret key rate is computed for several constellation shapes, sizes and detection quantum efficiency for a pure loss quantum channel. We show that the capacity achieving constellations with increasing cardinality in a classical context preserve the same pattern in a QKD context by approximating the performance of Gaussian modulation. We also verify that the non-unit quantum efficiency detection effect is more severe on discrete modulation, diminishing the protocol performance and limiting its link range to no more than 100 km. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Constellation cardinality; Discrete modulation; Unidimensional CVQKD","Efficiency; Modulation; Cardinalities; Classical context; Detection effect; Detection quantum efficiencies; Gaussian modulation; Intensity modulations; Protocol performance; Secret key; Quantum efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114052669"

The range of their applicability continues to expand, which demands the development of new DESs with improved properties. To do so requires an understanding of the fundamental relationship between the structure and properties of DESs. Computer simulation and machine learning techniques provide a fruitful approach as they can predict and reveal physical mechanisms and readily be linked to experiments. This review is devoted to the computational research of DESs and describes technical features of DES simulations and the corresponding perspectives on various DES applications.

The characterization of these materials and the TiO2/GOQDs composite was made using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), FT-IR spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The experimental measurements of the optical properties of these materials by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy indicate that the addition of GOQDs promotes the expansion of the radiation absorption of TiO2 towards the visible range. Similarly, photoelectrochemical tests performed to determine the electronic properties show that GOQDs improve the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, increasing the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2. These results were further contrasted with a computational study based on first-principles DFT-D3 calculations, using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method on TiO2, pristine GQDs, GOQDs, TiO2/GQDs, and TiO2/GOQDs clusters. The computational results showed that GOQDs exhibit properties of a p-type semiconductor due to the presence of oxygenated groups. Therefore, when used as TiO2/GOQDs composite, these form a type II heterojunction, increasing the photocatalytic activity of the material. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","DFT-D3; Graphene oxide quantum dots; Heterojunction; Photocatalytic activity; TiO<sub>2</sub>","Calculations; Carbonization; Dynamic light scattering; Electronic properties; Enamels; Field emission microscopes; Graphene oxide; Heterojunctions; Magnetic semiconductors; Nanocrystals; Optical properties; Photocatalytic activity; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor quantum dots; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Synthesis (chemical); TiO2 nanoparticles; DFT-d3; Experimental procedure; First principle calculations; Graphene oxide quantum dot; Graphene oxides; Optical and electronic properties; Photocatalytic activities; Property; Quantum-dot composites; TiO$-2$; Titanium dioxide","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104408584"

It is based on bolometric interferometry, an original detection technique which combines the immunity to systematic effects of an interferometer with the sensitivity of low temperature incoherent detectors. QUBIC will be deployed in Argentina, at the Alto Chorrillos mountain site near San Antonio de los Cobres, in the Salta province. The QUBIC detection chain consists of 2048 NbSi transition edge sensors (TESs) cooled to 320 mK. The voltage-biased TESs are read out with time domain multiplexing based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) at 1 K and a novel SiGe application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) at 60 K allowing an unprecedented multiplexing (MUX) factor equal to 128 to be reached. The current QUBIC version is based on a reduced number of detectors (1/4) in order to validate the detection technique. The QUBIC experiment is currently being validated in the lab in Salta (Argentina) before going to the site for observations. This paper presents the main results of the characterization phase with a focus on the detectors and readout system. © 2022 SPIE.","LaTeX; Manuscript format; SPIE Proceedings; Template","Cosmology; Interferometers; Interferometry; Niobium compounds; Si-Ge alloys; SQUIDs; Time domain analysis; Argentina; Bolometric interferometer; Cosmic microwaves background; Ground based; LaTeX; Manuscript format; Measurements of; SPIE proceedings; Template; Transition-edge sensors; Temperature","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140773665"

It is known that quantum walks mix at most quadratically faster than random walks on cycles, two-dimensional lattices, hypercubes, and bounded-degree graphs. In contrast, our numerical results show that it is possible to achieve a greater than quadratic quantum speedup for the mixing time on a subclass of GBPG (TLP with two consumers and m suppliers). We analyze two types of initial states. If the walker starts on a single node, the quantum mixing time does not depend on m, even though the graph diameter increases with it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of its kind. If the walker is initially spread over a maximal clique, the quantum mixing time is O(m/ɛ), where ɛ is the threshold used in the mixing times. This result is better than the classical mixing time, which is O(m1.5 /ɛ). © 2021 by the authors.

Moruzzi 1, Pisa, I-56124, Italy","The reliability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in predicting macroscopic properties of complex fluids and soft materials, such as liquid crystals, colloidal suspensions, or polymers, relies on the accuracy of the adopted force field (FF). We present an automated protocol to derive specific and accurate FFs, fully based on ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) data. The integration of the Joyce and Picky procedures, recently proposed by our group to provide an accurate description of simple liquids, is here extended to larger molecules, capable of exhibiting more complex fluid phases. While the standard Joyce protocol is employed to parameterize the intramolecular FF term, a new automated procedure is here proposed to handle the computational cost of the QM calculations required for the parameterization of the intermolecular FF term. The latter is thus obtained by integrating the old Picky procedure with a fragmentation reconstruction method (FRM) that allows for a reliable, yet computationally feasible sampling of the intermolecular energy surface at the QM level. The whole FF parameterization protocol is tested on a benchmark liquid crystal, and the performances of the resulting quantum mechanically derived (QMD) FF were compared with those delivered by a general-purpose, transferable one, and by the third, ""hybrid""FF, where only the bonded terms were refined against QM data. Lengthy atomistic MD simulations are carried out with each FF on extended 5CB systems in both isotropic and nematic phases, eventually validating the proposed protocol by comparing the resulting macroscopic properties with other computational models and with experiments. The QMD-FF yields the best performances, reproducing both phases in the correct range of temperatures and well describing their structure, dynamics, and thermodynamic properties, thus providing a clear protocol that may be explored to predict such properties on other complex fluids or soft materials. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110935399"

The use of auxiliary density perturbation theory (ADPT) in the framework of QM/MM is discussed using illustrative implementations including analytic second-order ADFT energy derivatives, nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift calculations and excited state calculations using time-dependent ADFT.

Recently, several real quantum devices have become available through the cloud. On the other hand, different possibilities on-premises allow having quantum computing simulators using High-Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities. Nevertheless, they did not expect to be very limited, in the near term, the number and quality of the fundamental storage element, the qubit. Therefore, software quantum simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However, the representation of quantum computing components in classical computers consumes significant resources. In quantum computing, a state composed of n qubits will be a union of all possible combinations of n 0s and 1s. That is to say, the size of the information is.

The vast majority of previous work focuses on music generation using gate-based quantum computers. An alternative model of computation is adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), and a heuristic algorithm known as quantum annealing running in the framework of AQC is a promising method for solving optimization problems. In this chapter, we lay the groundwork for music composition using quantum annealing. We approach the process of music composition as an optimization problem. We describe the fundamental methodologies needed for generating different aspects of music including melody, rhythm, and harmony. The discussed techniques are illustrated through examples to ease the understanding.

With the exerted efforts for realising large-scale quantum computers, most current cryptographic mechanisms may be hacked. Accordingly, we need a quantum tool utilised for designing blockchain frameworks to have the ability to be executed in the level of digital computers and resist the probable attacks from both digital and quantum computers. Quantum walks may be utilised as a quantum-inspired model for designing new cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a new authentication and encryption protocol based on quantum-inspired quantum walks (QIQW). The proposed protocol is utilized to build a blockchain framework for secure data transmission among IoT devices. Instead of using classical cryptographic hash functions, quantum hash functions based on QIQW are employed for linking blocks of the chain. The main advantages of the presented framework are helping IoT nodes to effectively share their data with other nodes and full control of their records. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed protocol can defend against message attack and impersonation attacks, thus ensuring secure transmission of data among IoT devices. © 2021","Authentication; Blockchain; Cybersecurity; Encryption; IoT; Quantum Computation; Quantum walks; Quantum-inspired; Smart City","Authentication; Blockchain; Cybersecurity; Data transfer; Hash functions; Internet of things; Quantum cryptography; Smart city; 'current; Block-chain; Cryptographic algorithms; CryptoGraphics; Cyber security; IoT; Large scale quantum computers; Quanta computers; Quantum walk; Quantum-inspired; Quantum computers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101670332"

We obtain an isogeny-based VDF construction with postquantum security, quasi-logarithmic verification, and requiring no trusted setup.

In a previous investigation, we introduced a novel distillation QKD algorithm whose secret key rate descends linearly with respect to the channel error rate. Now, as the main achievement of this work, we demonstrate an improved algorithm capable of retaining almost all the secret information enclosed in the regular binary frames. Remarkably, this technique increases quadratically the secret key rate as a function of the double matching detection events and doubly quadratically in the number of the quantum pulses. Furthermore, this reconciliation method opens up the opportunity to use less attenuated quantum pulses, would allow greater QKD distances at drastically increased secret key rate.

Embedded systems with constrained computing capabilities are a central part in IoT and CPS, susceptible to different security attacks and vulnerabilities. Lightweight cryptography is the term used for grouping the different cryptographic algorithms and techniques tailored to observe the requirements for data security in such constrained applications. Nowadays, the potential emergence of quantum computing threatens these security solutions widely in use. Thus, novel cryptographic algorithms deemed to resist quantum attack models are being standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standardization process.

The violation of Bell’s inequalities can, alternatively, be explained by assuming that the hidden variables do not exist at all, that they exist but their values cannot be simultaneously assigned, that the values can be assigned but joint probabilities cannot be properly defined, or that averages taken in different contexts cannot be combined.

However, in most cases, our atom-level knowledge of molecular systems has been obtained by manual data analyses based on selected descriptors. In this work, we introduce a data mining framework to accelerate the extraction of insights from QC datasets, which starts with a featurization process that converts atomic features into molecular properties (AtoMF). Then, it employs correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall) to investigate the AtoMF features relationship with a target property. We applied our framework to investigate three nanocluster systems, namely, PtnTM55-n, CenZr15-nO30, and (CHn + mH)/TM13. We found several interesting and consistent insights using Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients, indicating that they are suitable for our approach; however, our results indicate that the Pearson coefficient is very sensitive to outliers and should not be used. Moreover, we highlight problems that can occur during this analysis and discuss how to handle them. Finally, we make available a new Python package that implements the proposed QC data mining framework, which can be used as is or modified to include new features.  © ","","Algorithms; Data Mining; Research Design; Computational chemistry; Database systems; Extraction; Nanoclusters; Quantum chemistry; Computational power; Correlation coefficient; Data mining frameworks; Descriptors; Kendall correlation coefficients; Molecular properties; Molecular systems; Pearson coefficient; algorithm; data mining; methodology; Data mining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103306649"

With advancements in computational chemistry of chiroptical spectroscopy, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculation has emerged as a very promising tool. This paper attempts to illustrate the applicability of computational approaches in comparison with experimental data to understand the conformation, interaction, and stabilization of the loliolide’s isomers. The quantum chemical calculations were used from optimized geometries of the (6R,7aS)-, (6S,7aR)-, (6R,7aR)-, and (6S,7aS)-6-hydroxy-4,4,7a-trimethyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-1-benzofuran-2-one. The spectroscopic values were obtained for 13C NMR isotropic shielding by GIAO method in mPW1PW91/cc-pVTZ level, in TDDFT at the ωB97X-D/cc-pVTZ level to the circular dichroism, and in theoretical analyses of non-covalent interaction to study the isomer’s stability. The TDDFT calculation of circular dichroism can be used to quantify the individual isomers and the nature of excitation in the molecule. The (6R,7aS) and (6R,7aR) isomers present a higher stability due to electronegativity associated at the hydroxyl group.

Some strategies can be used to improve the parameters of these codes. For example, entanglement can provide a way for quantum error-correcting codes to achieve higher rates than the one obtained by means of the traditional stabilizer formalism. Such codes are called entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes. In this paper, we utilize algebraic geometry codes to construct several families of EAQEC codes derived from the Euclidean and the Hermitian construction. Three families constructed here consist of codes whose quantum Singleton defect is equal to zero, one, or two. We also construct families of EAQEC codes with an encoding rate exceeding the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Additionally, asymptotically good towers of linear complementary dual codes are used to obtain asymptotically good families of EAQEC codes consuming maximal entanglement. Furthermore, a simple comparison with the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound demonstrates that, by utilizing the proposed construction, it is possible to generate an asymptotically family of EAQEC codes that exceeds this bound. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","algebraic geometry codes; asymptotically good; maximal distance separable; maximal entanglement; Quantum codes","Algebra; Errors; Geometry; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Algebraic geometry code; Encoding rates; Gilbert-Varshamov bound; Quantum error correcting codes; Quantum system; Singleton defects; Stabilizer formalism; Suppressing noise; Codes (symbols)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115147659"

We consider quantum circuit cuts that split the circuit into smaller independent portions, and understand how faults propagate in each portion. As we show, the cuts have different vulnerabilities, and our methodology successfully identifies the circuit portion that is more likely to contribute to the overall circuit error rate. Our evaluation shows that a circuit cut can have a 4.6 x higher probability than the other cuts, when corrupted, to modify the circuit output.

The lower computational cost of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green's function methods allows the simulations of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW + fxc). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap; thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of a system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations in the intramolecular O-H bond distance and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond O···O distance and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O-H bond length; the O···O distance plays a secondary role, and the other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections.

When nuclear quantum effects are considered, broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O-H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110331881"

On the other hand, the increasing land occupation in recent centuries is a growing problem, demanding greater efficiency, particularly in the reuse of abandoned areas, which has become an alternative. An interesting alternative would be installing energy facilities like solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal, in these areas. So, in this way, the aim of this work is to classify these abandoned areas to verify which ones would be suitable for solar energy facilities specifically, to reuse those areas. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) were used for the classification task. The main innovation of this work is the optimization of the initial weights of the ANN using the Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) metaheuristic, through QPSO-LMA proposed algorithm. In terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), the QPSO-LMA approach achieved a decrease of 19.6% in relation to the classical LMA training with random initial weights. Moreover, the model’s accuracy showed an increase of 7.3% for the QPSO-LMA over the LMA. To validate this new approach, it was also tested on six different datasets available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and seven classical techniques established in the literature. For the problem of installing photovoltaic plants in abandoned areas, the knowledge acquired with the solar dataset can be extrapolated to other regions. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Artificial Neural Networks; Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization; Soil reuse; Solar energy","Fossil fuels; Geothermal energy; Mean square error; Neural networks; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Alternative source; Classification tasks; Energy; Energy programs; Initial weights; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Reuse; Soil reuse; Solar/wind; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125276462"

The entire class of Bell diagonal states is generated, and several characteristic indicators, namely entanglement of formation and concurrence, CHSH non-locality, steering and discord, are experimentally evaluated over the full parameter space and compared with theory. As a by-product of this work, we also find a remarkable general inequality between “quantum discord” and “asymmetric relative entropy of discord”: the former never exceeds the latter.

Quantum calculations on energy levels are reported for a water molecule inside C60fullerene by means of such a systematic approach that includes all nine degrees of freedom of H2O@C60and does not consider restrictions above them. The potential energy operator is represented as a sum of natural potentials employing then-mode expansion, along with the exact kinetic energy operator, by introducing a set of Radau internal coordinates for the H2O molecule. On the basis of the present rigorous computations, various aspects of the quantized intermolecular dynamics upon confinement of H2O@C60are discussed, such as the rotational energy level splitting and the significant frequency shifts of the encapsulated water molecule vibrations. The impact of water encapsulation on quantum features is explored, and insights into the nature of the underlying forces are provided, highlighting the importance of a reliable first-principles description of the guest-host interactions. © 2021 The Authors.

The AIMC method is a controlled approximation to nonadiabatic dynamics with a particular strength in the proper description of decoherence effects because of the branching of vibrational wavepackets at a level crossing. Here, we report a new implementation of the AIMC algorithm in the open source NWChem computational chemistry program. The framework combines linear-response time-dependent density functional theory with Ehrenfest mean-field theory to determine the equations of motion for classical trajectories. The multidimensional wave function is decomposed into a superposition of Gaussian coherent states guided by Ehrenfest trajectories (i.e., MCE approach), which can clone with fully quantum mechanical amplitudes and phases. By using an efficient time-derivative based nonadiabatic coupling approach within the AIMC method, all observables are calculated on-the-fly in the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics process. As a representative example, we apply our implementation to study the ultrafast photoinduced electronic and vibrational energy transfer in a pyridine molecule. The effects of the cloning procedure on electronic and vibrational coherence, relaxation and unidirectional energy transfer are discussed. This new AIMC implementation provides a high-level nonadiabatic molecular dynamics framework for simulating photoexcited dynamics in complex molecular systems and experimentally relevant ultrafast spectroscopic probes, such as nonlinear coherent optical and X-ray signals. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

The FAR-database provides NICS data of aromaticity of PAHs that could be used in data science and machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is available in the literature. The importance of this database lies in its potential to transform data into insight and knowledge. Additionally, a new visual representation of the NICS aromaticity pattern, based on the magnitude of the NICS value, is presented. Nowadays calculations of NICS(0)ZZ or NICS(1)ZZ have become popular methods to evaluate aromaticity of systems. By looking at all the 660 systems in the FAR-database, it becomes evident that NICS(0), NICS(1), and NICS(1)ZZ present similar NICS aromaticity patterns for most of the systems. But the NICS aromaticity patterns found with NICS(0)ZZ in many cases do not agree with the NICS aromaticity patterns found with NICS(0), NICS(1), and NICS(1)ZZ. There are cases where the NICS(0)ZZ aromaticity pattern does not show an aromatic character at all. From XY NICS scan at planes from Z = 0 to Z = 1, it is found that as the Z-height is increased, the π-electron ring current effects are dominant, and the σ-bonding contributions are diminished. Therefore, it is recommended here to compute NICS(1)ZZ instead of NICS(0)ZZ when analyzing NICS of PAHs.

A promising alternative is the nanomagnetic logic technology (NML), a paradigm of field-coupled nanocomputing. This technology applies single domain nanomagnets to implement digital logic with switching energies that are orders of magnitude lower than a CMOS transistor due to the complete absence of static energy dissipation. When designing nanomagnetic circuitry, several challenges arise, such as the design of a clocking system able to avoid signal disruption due to the thermal noise effect.

This disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, and on March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Today, over 21 million people have been infected, with more than 750.000 casualties. Today, no vaccine or antiviral drug is available. While the development of a vaccine might take at least a year, and for a novel drug, even longer; finding a new use to an old drug (drug repurposing) could be the most effective strategy. We present a docking-based screening using a quantum mechanical scoring of a library built from approved drugs and compounds undergoing clinical trials, against three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: the spike or S-protein, and two proteases, the main protease and the papain-like protease. The S-protein binds directly to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor of the human host cell surface, while the two proteases process viral polyproteins. Following the analysis of our structure-based compound screening, we propose several structurally diverse compounds (either FDA-approved or in clinical trials) that could display antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, these compounds should be further evaluated in experimental assays and clinical trials to confirm their actual activity against the disease.

Many works approach quantum walks to search for a single marked vertex. In this article, we experimentally address several problems related to quantum walk in the hypercube with self-loops to search for multiple marked vertices. We first investigate the quantum walk in the loopless hypercube. We saw that neighbor vertices are also amplified and that approximately 1/2 of the system energy is concentrated in them. We show that the optimal value of l for a single marked vertex is not optimal for multiple marked vertices. We define a new value of l= (n/ N) · k to search multiple marked vertices. Next, we use this new value of l found to analyze the search for multiple marked vertices non-adjacent and show that the probability of success is close to 1. We also use the new value of l found to analyze the search for several marked vertices that are adjacent and show that the probability of success is directly proportional to the density of marked vertices in the neighborhood. We also show that, in the case where neighbors are marked, if there is at least one non-adjacent marked vertex, the probability of success increases to close to 1. The results found show that the self-loop value for the quantum walk in the hypercube to search for several marked vertices is l= (n/ N) · k. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Quantum computing; Quantum search algorithm; Quantum walk","Probability; Quantum computers; Hyper-cubes; Loopless; Optimal values; Performance; Probability of success; Quantum Computing; Quantum search algorithm; Quantum walk; Self loops; System energy; Geometry","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121928084"

The lipid component of LLO in both eukarya and archaea consists of a dolichol, and an undecaprenol in prokarya, whereas the number of isoprene units may change between species. Given the potential relevance of LLOs and their related enzymes to diverse biotechnological applications, obtaining reliable LLO models from distinct domains of life could support further studies on complex formation and their processing by OSTs, as well as protein engineering on such systems. In this work, molecular modeling techniques, such as quantum mechanics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and metadynamics were employed to study eukaryotic (Glc3-Man9-GlcNAc2-PP-Dolichol), bacterial (Glc1-GalNAc5-Bac1-PP-Undecaprenol), and archaeal (Glc1-Man1-Gal1-Man1-Glc1-Gal1-Glc1-P-Dolichol) LLOs in membrane bilayers. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and metadynamics calculations of LLOs revealed that glycan chains are more prone to interact with the membrane lipid head groups, while the PP linkages are positioned at the lipid phosphate head groups level. The dynamics of isoprenoid chains embedded within the bilayer are described, and membrane dynamics and related properties are also investigated. Overall, there are similarities regarding the structure and dynamics of the eukaryotic, the bacterial, and the archaeal LLOs in bilayers, which can support the comprehension of their association with OSTs. These data may support future studies on the transferring mechanism of the oligosaccharide chain to an acceptor protein.

Likewise, random walks on graphs are a fundamental building block for a large number of algorithms with diverse applications. While the relationship between quantum and random walks has been recently discussed in specific scenarios, this work establishes a formal equivalence between the processes on arbitrary finite graphs and general conditions for shift and coin operators. It requires empowering random walks with time heterogeneity, where the transition probability of the walker is non-uniform and time dependent. The equivalence is obtained by equating the probability of measuring the quantum walk on a given vertex of the graph and the probability that the random walk is at that same vertex , for all vertices and time steps. The result is given by the construction procedure of a matrix sequence for the random walk that yields the exact same vertex probability distribution sequence of any given quantum walk, including the scenario with multiple interfering walkers. Interestingly, these matrices allow for a different simulation approach for quantum walks where vertex samples respect neighbor locality, and convergence is guaranteed by the law of large numbers, enabling efficient (polynomial) sampling of quantum graph trajectories (paths). Furthermore, the complexity of constructing this sequence of matrices is discussed in the general case. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Markov chains; Quantum walks; Random walks","Graph algorithms; Graphic methods; Matrix algebra; Probability distributions; Quantum computers; Random processes; Ubiquitous computing; Construction procedures; Diverse applications; Fundamental building blocks; Law of large numbers; Quantum Computing; Simulation approach; Time dependent; Transition probabilities; Graph theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095963429"

An enhancement of 12-fold in the diffraction efficiency was revealed when E0 increased from 0.0 to 4.2 kV/cm. The theoretical dependence of the diffraction efficiency and the holographic erasure time upon E0 was investigated using the standard model of Kukhtarev for photorefractivity and the results showed a good experimental data fitting in both cases, allowing the computation of the effective trap concentration (ND)eff ≈ 5.62 × 1015 cm−3 which is responsible by the recording mechanism into the crystal sample. In particular, the theoretical-experimental investigation using the holographic erasure time also allowed to determine others relevant parameters for Bi12TiO20 such as the diffusion transport length LD, the Maxwell relaxation time τM, and the quantum efficiency Φ that can explain the relatively slow dynamics of photorefractive recording and erasure in near-infrared region.

Two topics where it bears considerable impact are addressed, both at the heart of computational quantum chemistry: electronic structure and reaction dynamics. In the first, the problem of extrapolating the energy obtained by solving the electronic Schrödinger equation to the limit of the complete one-electron basis set is addressed. With the uniform-singlet-and-triplet-extrapolation (USTE) scheme at the focal point, the emphasis is on recent updates covering from the energy itself to other molecular properties. The second topic refers to extrapolation of quantum mechanical reactive scattering probabilities from zero total angular momentum to any of the values that it may assume when running quasiclassical trajectories, QCT/QM-αJ. With the extrapolation guided in both cases by physically motivated asymptotic theories, realism is seeked by avoiding unsecure jumps into the unknown. Although, mostly review oriented, a few issues are addressed for the first time here and there.

The bending movement is described in detail through the onset and disappearance of critical points defining two kinds of molecular structures, characterizing a transition state (TS) and predicting two stable equilibrium geometries. All points in this rich evolution and the structural change in the out of equilibrium conformations has been featured and distinguished by the behavior of the population magnitudes and of the paired and unpaired electron densities within the non-local and local points of view of the topological formalism. The unpaired or electron hole density appears as relevant in both versions, the non-local or integrated one, in which it is sometimes called free-valence and also for its complementary counterpart, the local one, to describe and to quantify the interatomic interactions. The stability of the cluster B3+ is characterized in terms of a topologically defined ring structure and the highest total two- and three-center populations, thus showing the role of the geometry, the covalence, and the complex patterns.

One is to forbid duplication of variables, while the other is to consider all lambda-terms as algebraic linear functions. The type system of Lambda-S has a constructor S such that a type A is considered as the base of a vector space while S(A) is its span. Lambda-S can also be seen as a language for the computational manipulation of vector spaces: The vector spaces axioms are given as a rewrite system, describing the computational steps to be performed. In this paper we give an abstract categorical semantics of Lambda-S∗ (a fragment of Lambda-S), showing that S can be interpreted as the composition of two functors in an adjunction relation between a Cartesian category and an additive symmetric monoidal category.

Many countries are engaged in combating drug trafficking and drug use because they are related to public health and safety issues. Prohibiting the consumption of traditional drugs has led new psychoactive substances (NPSs) to emerge. NPSs consist of compounds that resemble the initially banned substance and which aim to mimic the traditional drug recreational effects while circumventing drug legislation. For example, synthetic cannabinoids are sprayed on herbal products to reproduce the cannabis recreational effects. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the toxic effects of synthetic cannabis types are unknown, and harm and fatalities associated with the use of these drugs have been reported. Information on the characterization related to these species is lacking. The rate at which NPSs appear poses a significant challenge because employing conventional methods to understand the characteristics of these compounds may require time and be costly. This work uses in silico practices as an alternative to understand how NPSs related to cannabis behave. We apply quantum chemistry methods to evaluate several synthetic cannabinoids recognized in forensic samples. More specifically, we generate infrared spectra that can be employed as a benchmark for NPSs. We apply a multivariate classification to evaluate the results. We conclude that in silico methods are an alternative that provide information about the spectra of undetected substances. This information can help to identify new drugs, to increase knowledge about them, and to feed information procedures.

In some cases, the structures have been also refined with DFT and coupled-cluster methods. The general trends of sodium-lithium structures are in line with previous studies. The ionization potentials and polarizabilities to all structures were calculated with MP2 method and the average error between these two properties compared with experimental data was 6% and 13%, respectively. The topological analysis based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) showed that by increasing the cluster size of the diatomic system there was a decrease of atomic interaction energies. The degree of degeneracy from D3BIA aromaticity index and the analysis of the atomic charges showed the influence (by charge transfer) of the chemical element in lower quantity in the cluster with respect to the other atoms. Our achievements of comparing our theoretical results with available experimental data have demonstrated that our approach can also predict satisfactorily quantum atomic and alloy clusters properties, at least, for low nuclearities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coupled-cluster; D3BIA; Metal clusters; MP2; QTAIM; Quantum genetic algorithm","Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Electrons; Lithium; Models, Molecular; Quantum Theory; Sodium; Thermodynamics; lithium ion; sodium ion; lithium; sodium; ab initio calculation; Article; genetic algorithm; ionization; nonhuman; priority journal; quantum theory; theoretical study; algorithm; chemistry; computer simulation; electron; molecular model; thermodynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093958690"

This approach allows determining efficiently, in terms of a proposed effective magnetic spin model, an optimal set of magnetic configurations to be simulated by DFT methods. Moreover, a procedure to estimate the values of the coupling constants and their error bounds from the estimated energies is proposed. This method, based on Monte Carlo sampling, takes into account the accuracy of the ab-initio simulations. A strategy to refine models reusing previously computed configuration energies is also presented.

A special version of this approach, the cluster-continuum quasichemical model, has also been used for establishing a single-ion solvation free energy scale in different solvents compatible with the tetraphenylarsonium tetraphenylborate assumption. The use of discrete-continuum solvation methods can lead to meaningful improvement with respect to pure continuum solvation models for modeling diverse chemical process in solution. In the case of pKa calculations, there are cases where the root mean squared error is as large as 7 pKa units with pure continuum solvation model and becomes around 1 pKa unit with the hybrid approach. For complex reactions in solution, errors as large as 10 kcal/mol for activation free energies with the pure continuum approach can be substantially reduced with the inclusion of explicit solvent molecules. A discussion of the theory of hybrid discrete-continuum methods is also presented and further development is expected in the coming years. This article is categorized under:.

In this scenario, thermodynamic processes with no heat exchange, namely, adiabatic transformations, can be implemented through quantum evolutions in closed systems, even though the notion of a closed system is always an idealization and approximation. Here, we begin by theoretically discussing thermodynamic adiabatic processes in open quantum systems, which evolve non-unitarily under decoherence due to its interaction with its surrounding environment. From a general approach for adiabatic non-unitary evolution, we establish heat and work in terms of the underlying Liouville superoperator governing the quantum dynamics. As a consequence, we derive the conditions that an adiabatic open-system quantum dynamics implies in the absence of heat exchange, providing a connection between quantum and thermal adiabaticity. Moreover, we determine families of decohering systems exhibiting the same maximal heat exchange, which imply in classes of thermodynamic adiabaticity in open systems. We then approach the problem experimentally using a hyperfine energy-level quantum bit of an Ytterbium 171Yb+ trapped ion, which provides a work substance for thermodynamic processes, allowing for the analysis of heat and internal energy throughout a controllable engineered dynamics. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Dynamics; Heat exchangers; Ions; Quantum optics; Thermodynamics; Adiabatic transformation; Experimental realizations; Laws of thermodynamics; Open quantum systems; Quantum mechanical; Quantum thermodynamics; Surrounding environment; Thermodynamic process; Trapped ions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089873783"

This work reports a theoretical conformational analysis of a thymidine kinase enzyme ligand (NMF) that is prone to experience an F⋯HO intramolecular hydrogen bond, inside and outside the biological binding site. This interaction stabilizes the most favorable conformations of NMF in the gas phase and, although it can be disrupted in a biological environment due to intermolecular hydrogen bonds in some cases, these interactions are competitive in other systems. Therefore, an intramolecular hydrogen bond can affect the conformational likeliness most related to the bioactivity.

In this paradigm, it is postulated that all information entering a black hole is rapidly and chaotically distributed across the event horizon, making it impossible to reconstruct the information by means of any local measurement. However, in this scenario, the effects of decoherence are typically ignored, which may render information scrambling moot in cosmological settings. In this work, we develop key steps toward a thermodynamic description of information scrambling in open quantum systems. In particular, we separate the entropy change into contributions arising from scrambling and decoherence, for which we derive statements of the second law. This is complemented with a numerical study of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev, Maldacena-Qi, XXX, mixed-field Ising, and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models in the presence of decoherence in the energy or in the computational basis. © 2021 authors.

Physical insights regarding IC photoexcitation and photolysis were obtained from a fundamental perspective through quantum chemistry computations. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the ground state while its time-dependent formalism (TD-DFT) was used for probing excited state properties, such as vertical excitation energies, generalized oscillator strengths (GOS), and structures. All the computations were undertaken using two different approaches: M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) and CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p), in water. Results determined using both methods are in systematic agreement. For instance, the first singlet excited state was found at 2.28 eV (with GOS = 0.4730) and 2.19 eV (GOS = 0.4695) at the TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and TD-DFT/M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) levels of theory, respectively. Excellent agreement was observed between the computed and the corresponding experimental UV-Vis spectra. Moreover, results suggest IC undergoes photodecomposition through excited state chemical reaction rather than via a direct photolysis path. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle the photoexcitation, and its potential connections to photodegradation, of IC from a fundamental chemical perspective, being presented with expectations to motivate further studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Density functional theory (DFT); Dye degradation; Indigo carmine; Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)","indigo carmine; Article; chemical reaction; density functional theory; excitation; photodegradation; photolysis; priority journal; quantum chemistry; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093817073"

Our mechanism and calculated free energy barrier for the reaction, 64.9 kJ mol− 1, are in good agreement with those predicted from experiment.

Despite many published studies, aspects of their interaction persist an unsolved puzzle. Hence, in this work, we used quantum mechanic approaches based on density functional theory to study this topic. Our calculations revealed that interaction between MAO and TMA occurs initially by the formation of an intermediary Lewis adduct. In agreement with the latent acidity concept, the activation energy for the tensioned Al–O bond break is small, and changes with the local environment of the MAO cages. Breakage of bond belonging to two square faces requires between 4.20 and 5.80 kcal/mol, whereas square-hexagonal faces demand 0.61–9.43 kcal/mol. The products of this reaction present a terminal, acidic 3-coordinate aluminum atom, that can be capped by another TMA molecules. However, our computations suggest that entropic effects may prevent this reaction from occurring at all these sites in the MAO models studied. Additionally, we also characterize the inter/intramolecular methane elimination mechanism. These reactions are not feasible at room temperature but may occur at high temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","DFT study; MAO structure; MAO TMA interaction; Methylaluminoxane","Activation energy; Electronic structure; Entropy; Organometallics; Quantum theory; aluminum; aluminum derivative; Lewis acid; methylaluminoxane; oxygen; trimethylaluminium; unclassified drug; Aluminum atoms; Entropic effects; High temperature; Local environments; Methylaluminoxane; Organometallic catalysis; Transition state; Trimethylaluminium; acidity; Article; chemical bond; chemical interaction; chemical structure; density functional theory; entropy; molecule; priority journal; quantum mechanics; Density functional theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084826420"

It mediates slow and prolonged inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system, representing an attractive target for the treatment of various disorders. However, the molecular mechanism of the GABAB receptor is not thoroughly understood. Therefore, a better description of the binding of existing agonists and antagonists to this receptor is crucial to improve our knowledge about G protein-coupled receptor structure as well as for helping the development of new potent and more selective therapeutic agents. In this work, we used the recent X-ray cocrystallization data of agonists (GABA and baclofen) and antagonists (2-hydroxysaclofen, SCH50911, and CGP54626) bound to the GABAB orthosteric site together with quantum biochemistry and the molecular fractionation with conjugate caps (MFCC) scheme to describe the individual contribution of each amino acid residue involved in the GABAB-ligand interaction, pointing out differences and similarities among the compounds. Our quantum biochemical computational results show that the total binding energy of the ligands to the GABAB ligand pocket, with radius varying from 2.0 to 9.0 Å, is well-correlated with the experimental binding affinity. In addition, we found that the binding site is very similar for agonists or antagonists, showing small differences in the importance of the most significant amino acids. Finally, we predict the energetic relevance of the regions of the five ligands as well as the influence of each protein lobe on GABAB-ligand binding. These results provide important new information on the binding mechanism of the GABAB receptor and should facilitate the development of new chemicals targeting this receptor.

In this paper, a quantum-behaved bat algorithm (QBA) is implemented to solve a nonlinear economic load dispatch (ELD) problem. The objective of ELD is to find an optimal combination of power generating units in order to minimize total fuel cost of the system, while satisfying all other constraints. To make the system more applicable to the real-world problem, a valve-point effect is considered here with the ELD problem. QBA is applied in 3-unit, 10-unit, and 40-unit power generation systems for different load demands. The obtained result is then presented and compared with some well-known methods from the literature such as different versions of evolutionary programming (EP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), simulated annealing (SA) and hybrid ABC_PSO. The comparison of results shows that QBA performs better than the above-mentioned methods in terms of solution quality, convergence characteristics and computational efficiency. Thus, QBA proves to be an effective and a robust technique to solve such nonlinear optimization problem.

This can be performed on top of any electronic structure code, as long as the band and projection information is written in the PROCAR format, as done by the VASP and ABINIT codes. PyProcar can be easily modified to read other formats as well. This package is particularly suitable for understanding atomic effects into the band structure, Fermi surface, spin texture, etc. PyProcar can be conveniently used in a command line mode, where each one of the parameters define a plot property. In the case of Fermi surfaces, the package is able to plot the surface with colors depending on other properties such as the electron velocity or spin projection. The mesh used to calculate the property does not need to be the same as the one used to obtain the Fermi surface. A file with a specific property evaluated for each k-point in a k−mesh and for each band can be used to project other properties such as electron–phonon mean path, Fermi velocity, electron effective mass, etc. Another existing feature refers to the band unfolding of supercell calculations into predefined unit cells. Program summary: Program Title: PyProcar Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/d4rrfy3dy4.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python Nature of problem: To automate, simplify and serialize the analysis of band structure and Fermi surface, especially for high throughput calculations. Solution method: Implementation of a Python library able to handle, combine, parse, extract, plot and even repair data from density functional calculations. PyProcar uses color maps on the band structures or Fermi surfaces to give a simple representation of the relevant characteristics of the electronic structure. Additional comments: Features: PyProcar can produce high-quality figures of band structures and Fermi surfaces (2D and 3D), projection of atomic orbitals, atoms, and/or spin components. Restrictions: Only the VASP package is currently fully supported, the latest version of Abinit is partially supported (it will be fully supported in the Abinit versions 9.x).

After a brief introduction of GA, the applications of GA are reviewed across many fields. We discuss the characteristics of the applications of GA to various problems of computer science and engineering. In addition, the challenges and prospects of various applications proposed by many researchers are analyzed. We analyze the developments using GA in image processing, computer vision, neurocomputing, quantum computing, robot modeling, control, and tracking, as well as improvement of computer hardware performance. We believe that up to now GA has proven to be a powerful geometric language for a variety of applications. Furthermore, there is evidence that this is the appropriate geometric language to tackle a variety of existing problems and that consequently, step-by-step GA-based algorithms should continue to be further developed. We also believe that this extensive review will guide and encourage researchers to continue the advancement of geometric computing for intelligent machines.  © 2013 IEEE.","and biotechnology; artificial intelligence; biomedical engineering; Clifford algebra; computer vision; control engineering; electrical engineering and power systems; Geometric algebra; geometric and quantum computing; graphic engineering; image processing; machine learning; neural networks; quaternion algebra; robotics; screw theory; signal processing","Algebra; Computer hardware; Geometry; Image enhancement; Intelligent computing; Quantum computers; Computer science and engineerings; Engineering and computer science; GA-based algorithm; Geometric computing; Geometric languages; Hardware performance; Intelligent machine; Quaternion algebra; Genetic algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110887255"

This methodology proposed here can be naturally employed as data preprocessing for classification task. A classical real world system will be viewed as a composition of quantum systems, where any observable measurement process of the real world data are created from an expected value measure of a quantum system state. In this projection measure a quantum phase information is naturally lost, making the inverse mapping from the classical space into quantum space impossible. However, it is possible find an arbitrate quantum state that represents the same classical information originally measured. A genetic algorithm is employed for search this arbitrate quantum state, going back from classical world to quantum world representation. The genetic algorithm searches for a compatible quantum state with the real world data, where the lost quantum phase is adjusted with the constraints to minimize the classes’ variance and to maximize the distance between the classes’ centroids. Computational simulations shown that the proposed methodology was able to transform a non linearly separable problem in classical representation space into a linearly separable problem in the quantum representation space, demonstrating an enhancement of data discrimination power. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Classification; Data discrimination power; Machine learning; Preprocessing data; Quantum representation","Genetic algorithms; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Quantum optics; Classical information; Classical representation; Classification tasks; Computational simulation; Data discriminations; Preprocessing data; Quantum representation; Representation space; article; genetic algorithm; machine learning; simulation; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062146021"

Computation and information transfer in QCA are based on field forces rather than electric currents. As a consequence, new strategies are required for design automation approaches in order to cope with the arising challenges. One of these challenges is the transport of information, which is affected by two particularities of the QCA technology. First, information flow in QCA is controlled by external clocks, and second, QCA is a planar technology in which gates, as well as interconnections, are mostly located in the same layer. The former demands proper synchronization already during the circuit design phase, while the latter results in high area costs for interconnections. This work focuses on both constraints and discusses its impact on the implementation of QCA circuits. Further, the concept of local and global synchronicity in QCA circuits is explored. The obtained results indicate that relaxing the global synchronicity constraint can reduce design size by about 70% while the throughput performance declines by similar values.

Due to the photoelectric effect, certain substances emit photons after being exposed to solar energy. In research in Mexico and Europe, these substances were applied to obtain a photoluminescent effect on bicycle paths. The objective of the research is to investigate the behavior of polymeric residues with the luminescent effect of rare-earth materials in the production of concrete artifacts to illuminate pedestrian and cyclist paths. The concrete blocks were produced with the addition of polymeric recycling waste and luminescent materials, exposed to solar radiation, and tested for mechanical strength. The results of the experiments showed that the polymer residue in concrete significantly increases photon emission, especially when it is processed by extrusion. Although the mixture of photoluminescent materials and polymers reduces the strength of concrete, it still met research objectives for a product meant to illuminate pedestrian and cyclist paths. © 2021","Concrete; Photoelectric effect; Photoluminescence; Polymers","Photoelectricity; Photons; Rare earths; Solar energy; Exposed to; Luminescent effects; Luminescent material; Luminescent polymer; Luminescent substances; Me-xico; Polymer residue; Quantum physics; Rare-earth materials; Recycling wastes; Photoluminescence","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120717786"

During its time the implementation of these tools abolished the classic security systems, as by means of cryptanalysis they allowed decryption of information in a fast, automated, and simple mode from these systems. Considering this scenario, the same happens when quantum cryptographic systems are implemented, insomuch as the current security systems could be abolished, as tools exist that permit its encryption in a simple way, but with the risk of putting the data of worldwide organizations in danger. With the purpose of mitigating these risks, it is necessary to consider the upgrade of the available security systems, by security systems and quantic encryption, before a massive implementation of the quantum computer's use as an everyday tool. With this it does not mean that quantum computing would be a disadvantage, on the contrary, the advantages from this technology will mean that security information and data are almost invulnerable, which is a meaningful advance in the IT field. With security information professionals are obliged to recommend and perform an appropriate migration of new technologies to avoid existing exposition risks as data as well as transactions.

With the development and innovating new techniques for 5G-IoT, it surely will drive to new enormous security and privacy challenges. Consequently, secure techniques for data transmissions will be needed as the basis for 5G-IoT technology to address these arising challenges. Therefore, various traditional security mechanisms are provided for 5G-IoT technologies and most of them are built on mathematical foundations. With the growth of quantum technologies, traditional cryptographic techniques may be compromised due to their mathematical computation based construction. Quantum walks (QWs) is a universal quantum computational model, which possesses inherent cryptographic features that can be utilized to build efficient cryptographic mechanisms. In this paper, we use the features of quantum walk to construct a new S-box method which plays a significant role in block cipher techniques for 5G-IoT technologies. As an application of the presented S-box mechanism and controlled alternate quantum walks (CAQWs) for 5G-IoT technologies a new robust video encryption mechanism is proposed. As well as to fulfill needs of encryption for varied files in 5G-IoT, we utilize the features of quantum walk to propose a novel encryption strategy for secure transmission of sensitive files in 5G-IoT paradigm.

Although the EFISHG technique cannot be applied to charged compounds (due to the external static electric field), it can be used to describe ion pairs as neutral complexes. A multiscale computational approach is required to generate representative geometrical configurations of such kinds of complexes (using classical force fields), to compute the electronic structure of each configuration (using quantum mechanics methods), and to perform statistical analyses describing the behavior of the nonlinear optical properties. In this work, we target solvated neutral ion pairs complexes, of which the cation is an organic chromophore, and we estimate their EFISHG and hyper-Rayleigh scattering responses. It is shown that the anion-cation relative spatial distribution determines the permanent dipole moment of the complexes, and therefore the relative distance controls the EFISHG response. On the other hand, the β tensor is independent of the dipole moment and it shows a weak linear correlation with the π-electron conjugation length of the cations. The γ contributions in the global EFISHG response range from 5% to 15%, which is mostly due to the variations of amplitude of the μβ∥ contribution, which results from differences in the μ and β vectors’ orientations. The applied multiscale approach provides reasonable results compared with experimental ones, although additional efforts are still required to improve such comparison mainly to consider the possible dissociation effects. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","","Cations; Computer Simulation; Electricity; Electrons; Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy; Chromophores; Dipole moment; Electric fields; Electronic structure; Harmonic generation; Nonlinear optics; Optical properties; Positive ions; Quantum theory; cation; Classical force fields; Computational approach; Electric field induced second-harmonic generations; Geometrical configurations; Hyper Rayleigh scattering; Multi-scale simulation method; Non-linear optical properties; Static electric fields; computer simulation; electricity; electron; second harmonic generation microscopy; Organic polymers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094684949"

Although quantum computing simulation is parallel by nature, spatial and temporal complexity are major performance hazards.

Considering these scenarios, six quantum simulators are studied, in order to find out their main features and simulation results considering implementations classified in single/multiple processor and accelerator architectures.

By using the adjacency matrices associated with the tessellations, we define local unitary operators, whose product is the evolution operator of our quantum walk model.

In quantum computing (QC), classical ML models are currently being used to discriminate in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signal data to discriminate between quantum states, which is a fundamental QC operation. In our research we propose a Quantum K-Means (QK-Means) clustering technique to discriminate quantum states on the IBM Bogota quantum device, and compare its performance to the K-Means technique (its classical counterpart). We used both algorithms to perform a correlation analysis and probe cross-talk between couples of qubits on the device. We observed that QK-Means obtained test and training scores at par with the classical K-Means, and testing scores that were marginally lower than K-Means when the clusters weren't visually separable. The training times for QK-Means were observed to be at par with an implementation of the K-Means that was not optimized. In this case, we concluded a weak correlation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.2 on the (1, 2) and (2, 3) qubit couples. After analyzing the training scores, we also conclude that the 1 qubit has the worst performance at readout evidenced by the signal data not being visually separable and the low scores obtained on both clustering algorithms compared to the other qubits.

Regarding quantum physics, it has been only in the previous decade or so that the corresponding literature resulted in a set of defying papers. In such a context, this manuscript constitutes a cordial invitation, whose purpose is simply to suggest, mostly through a heuristic and unpretentious presentation, the extension of fractional quantum mechanics to cosmological settings. Being more specific, we start by outlining a historical summary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation, a (very) brief appraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details (namely those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing. Subsequently, the application of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is introduced, advocating it as worthy to consider: if the progress of fractional calculus serves as argument, indeed useful consequences will also be drawn (to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that may affect the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of minisuperspace covariance and fractional derivatives, for instance. An example of investigation is provided by means of a very simple model. Concretely, we restrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements, we may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard cosmology. In summary, the subject of fractional quantum cosmology is herewith proposed, merely realised in terms of an open program constituted by several challenges. © 2020 by the authors.","Early universe; Fractional calculus; Quantum cosmology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082407791"

To achieve this end, we need to understand the mechanisms that govern plant growth responses under drought conditions. In this study, we combined physiological, transcriptomic, and genomic data to provide a comprehensive picture of drought and recovery responses in the leaves and roots of sugarcane. Transcriptomic profiling using oligoarrays and RNA-seq identified 2898 (out of 21,902) and 46,062 (out of 373,869) transcripts as differentially expressed, respectively. Co-expression analysis revealed modules enriched in photosynthesis, small molecule metabolism, alpha-amino acid metabolism, trehalose biosynthesis, serine family amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate transport. Together, our findings reveal that carbohydrate metabolism is coordinated with the degradation of amino acids to provide carbon skeletons to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This coordination may help to maintain energetic balance during drought stress adaptation, facilitating recovery after the stress is alleviated. Our results shed light on candidate regulatory elements and pave the way to biotechnology strategies towards the development of drought-tolerant sugarcane plants. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite the experimental advances, such a task should normally be complemented with physical computer simulations to understand its complexity. Several methods have been explored to model this quantum phenomenon, mainly using the quantum open systems theory as a first approach. The traditional methods used in this approach do not take into account the memory effects of the surroundings, which is commonly approximated as a phonon bath on thermal equilibrium. To surpass such an approximation, this article applies the Hierarchical Equations of Motion method, a non-markovian approach also used to analyze the dynamic of such a complex, for the modeling of the system evolution. We perform a parametric analysis about some physical features in the quantum regime involved during the quantum excitation process in order to get a comprehension about its non-trivial dependence on operation parameters. Thus, the analysis is conducted in terms of some relevant physical parameters in the system to track the complex global behavior in aspects as coherence, entanglement, decoherence times, transference times, and efficiency of the main process of energy capturing. As a complementary analysis from the derived outcomes, we compare those features for two different species as a suggestive possible roadmap to track genetic differences in the photosynthetic performance of the complex through its biological nature. © 2020 by the authors.","Coherence; Fenna-matthews-olson; Light-harvesting complexes; Quantum entanglement; Quantum open systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091906203"

In them, a control quantum system can coherently determine the order in which a target quantum system undergoes N gate operations. This process, known as the quantum N-switch, is a resource for several information-processing tasks. In particular, it provides a computational advantage - over fixed-gate-order quantum circuits - for phase-estimation problems involving N unknown unitary gates. However, the corresponding algorithm requires an experimentally unfeasible target-system dimension (super)exponential in N. Here, we introduce a promise problem for which the quantum N-switch gives an equivalent computational speedup with target-system dimension as small as 2 regardless of N. We use state-of-the-art multicore optical-fiber technology to experimentally demonstrate the quantum N-switch with N=4 gates acting on a photonic-polarization qubit. This is the first observation of a quantum superposition of more than N=2 temporal orders, demonstrating its usefulness for efficient phase estimation.  © 2021 authors.

However, these agents are very dangerous and toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. Thus, investigations with reactivators have been deeply developed in order to design new antidotes with better efficiency, as well as a greater spectrum of action in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivation process. With that in mind, in this work, we investigated the behavior of trimedoxime toward the Mus musculus acetylcholinesterase (MmAChE) inhibited by a range of nerve agents, such as chemical weapons. From experimental assays, reactivation percentages were obtained for the reactivation of different AChE–OP complexes. On the other hand, theoretical calculations were performed to assess the differences in interaction modes and the reactivity of trimedoxime within the AChE active site. Comparing theoretical and experimental data, it is possible to notice that the oxime, in most cases, showed better reactivation percentages at higher concentrations, with the best result for the reactivation of the AChE–VX adduct. From this work, it was revealed that the mechanistic process contributes most to the oxime efficiency than the interaction in the site. In this way, this study is important to better understand the reactivation process through trimedoxime, contributing to the proposal of novel antidotes. © 2020 by the authors.

Data security of computing tasks is the most important consideration in edge computing. Ensuring data security will bring additional communication load. Many researchers have proposed effective solutions to reduce the communication load. However, they did not further consider the communication cost in edge computing, i.e., the sum of the cost of each data transmission over the network, which includes communication load (the total amount of data transmission over the network). In this paper, we use communication cost instead of communication load and take matrix multiplication as the computing tasks to study the problem of secure matrix multiplication in edge computing with minimum communication cost (SMC). Specifically, we first theoretically analyze the security and decodability conditions of SMC to get the maximum number of matrix multiplication tasks stored on each edge device. Then we propose a scheme, i.e., Minimum Communication cost Secure coded Edge Computing (MCSEC), which adopts dynamic allocation and linear coding methods to allocate the matrix multiplication tasks to multiple edge devices and complete the coding design to satisfy the requirement of information-theoretic security (ITS), respectively. Moreover, we prove that the MCSEC achieves minimum communication cost by using constructive and logical analysis methods. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate the efficiency of MCSEC. The experiment results demonstrate that the MCSEC effectively reduces the communication cost (up to 71%) compared with other schemes. © 2020 IEEE.","Communication cost; Edge computing; Linear coding; Matrix multiplication; Task allocation","Big data; Cost benefit analysis; Data transfer; Digital storage; Edge computing; Efficiency; Information theory; Quantum cryptography; Security of data; Social networking (online); Storage as a service (STaaS); Communication capabilities; Communication load; Dynamic allocations; Effective solution; Emerging technologies; Extensive simulations; Information- theoretic securities; MAtrix multiplication; Matrix algebra","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108022950"

By combining the power of the approximate DFTB method with the semiclassical Ehrenfest method for nuclear-electron dynamics, we have achieved a real-time time-dependent DFTB (TD-DFTB) implementation that fits such requirements. In addition to enabling the study of nuclear motion effects in photoinduced charge transfer processes, our code adds novel features to the realm of static and time-resolved computational spectroscopies. In particular, the optical properties of periodic materials such as graphene nanoribbons or the use of corrections such as the ""LDA+U""and ""pseudo SIC""methods to improve the optical properties in some systems can now be handled at the TD-DFTB level. Moreover, the simulation of fully atomistic time-resolved transient absorption spectra and impulsive vibrational spectra can now be achieved within reasonable computing time, owing to the good performance of the implementation and a parallel simulation protocol. Its application to the study of UV/visible light-induced vibrational coherences in molecules is demonstrated and opens a new door into the mechanisms of nonequilibrium ultrafast phenomena in countless materials with relevant applications.

By employing an active-site model based on the X-ray crystal structure of PLAP, mutations of several key residues were modeled by quantum mechanical methods in order to determine their impact on the catalytic activity. Kinetic and thermodynamic estimations were achieved for each reaction step of the catalytic mechanism by characterization of the intermediates and transition states on the reaction pathway, and the effects of mutations on the activation barriers were analyzed.

In this work, we propose a Particle Swarm Optimized methodology to generate non-intuitive structures that couple light vertically from a III-V platform to a silicon-on-insulator chip. By designing heuristically optimized III-V and silicon tapers, we can overcome the limitations of typical linearly-varying spot-size converters in terms of footprint, without sacrificing bandwidth.

We identified a set of five performance efficiency and reliability related non-functional requirements that should considered when implementing a quantum program for a quantum device. We also discuss available solution options to address the requirements. There are high level solutions to deal with the hardware-related constraints described in our identified requirements.

This work introduces the mapping of a graph coloring problem based on pseudo-Boolean constraints to a working graph of the D-Wave Systems Inc. We start from the problem formulated as a set of constraints represented in propositional logic. We use the SATyrus approach to transform this set of constraints to an energy minimization problem. We convert the formulation to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO), applying polynomial reduction when needed, and solve the problem using different approaches: (a) classical QUBO using simulated annealing in a von Neumann machine; (b) QUBO in a simulated quantum environment; (c) actual quantum 1, QUBO using the D-Wave quantum machine and reducing polynomial degree using a D-Wave library; and (d) actual quantum 2, QUBO using the D-Wave quantum machine and reducing polynomial degree using our own implementation. We study how the implementations using these approaches vary in terms of the impact on the number of solutions found (a) when varying the penalties associated with the constraints and (b) when varying the annealing approach, simulated (SA) versus quantum (QA). Results show that both SA and QA produce good heuristics for this specific problem, although we found more solutions through the QA approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adiabatic quantum computation; Constraint and logic programming; Pseudo-Boolean optimization; Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization; Symbolic calculus algorithms","Boolean functions; Combinatorial optimization; Graph theory; Mapping; Polynomials; Quantum theory; Simulated annealing; Binary optimization; Combinatorial optimization problems; Complex energy landscapes; Energy minimization problem; Graph coloring problem; Polynomial reduction; Pseudo-boolean constraints; Thermal fluctuations; Annealing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114079597"

This scheduling must achieve multiple objectives while considering different types of constraints. Uninterrupted processing unit operation, on-time crude oil batch receipts, and tank switchover minimization coexist in the everyday reasoning of a scheduler. However, it is not usual that works encompassing many operational aspects, such as multiple operational objectives, settling time, and an unlimited number of crudes, to blend in any tank. This article proposes a new algorithm that integrates linear and grammar-guided genetic programming concepts with a quantum-inspired approach to create programs that represent a crude oil refinery scheduling solution. The fitness function comprises four objectives that guide the evolution based on importance predefined by the decision maker. We propose a success ratio to evaluate the algorithm performance considering 50 runs for each case. A final solution is considered a success if two more important objectives are optimized.

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems. In the problem of diagnosing diabetes, quantum neurons achieved an accuracy rate of 76% and AUC-ROC of 88%, while its classic version, the perceptron, reached only 63% accuracy and the artificial neural network reached 80% AUC-ROC. These results indicate that a single quantum neuron performs better than its classical version and even the artificial neural network for AUC-ROC, demonstrating potential for use in healthcare applications in the near future. © 2021 IEEE.","Diabetes Prediction; Healthcare; Machine Learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Neurons; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Accuracy rate; Diabetes prediction; Hypercomplex number; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neuron; Single quantum; Health care","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125801942"

It is widely recognised that the original version of STGF was written by M.J. Seaton in 1983, but through constant refinement over the next decades by worldwide contributors has evolved into its current form that more reflects modern coding practice and current computer architectures. Despite its current wide acceptance, it was never formally published. Therefore, we present an updated high-performance parallel version of PSTGF, that balances the requirements of small university clusters, yet can exploit the computational power of cutting edge supercomputers. There are many improvements over the original STGF, but most noticeably, the full introduction of MQDT options that provide subsequent integration with ICFT (Intermediate Coupling Frame Transformation) codes, and for either Breit–Pauli/DARC (Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes), better load balancing, high levels of vectorisation and simplified output. Semantically, the program is full Fortran 90 in conjunction with MPI (Message Passing Interface) though has CUDA Fortran options for the most numerically intensive code sections. Program summary: Program Title: RMATRX-PSTGF CPC Library link to program files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3j55fmr86g.1 Licensing provisions: GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: The R-matrix outer region code, PSTGF directly calculates various electron-impact driven processes such as excitation and ionisation, or provides K-matrices for input for subsequent ICFT, differential or magnetic sub-level codes. As the problem size increases, there is an associated increase in the input/output, the numerical computation and unbalanced workload, especially for electron-impact energies where the number of open-channels is of a similar size to the number of closed. The code has been significantly modified to address these issues. PSTGF interfaces the R-matrix inner region with the outer region, with the R-matrix acting as intermediary between the two regions. The outer region expresses an electron moving in the multi-pole expansion of the target and predominantly employs Coulomb functions, perturbed or otherwise to achieve this. This is a computationally expensive task, as the R-matrix must be formed for every energy point of every partial wave. Solution method: An approach that permutes both the partial wave and energy of the incident electron has been implemented. In this version, each processor does not calculate the same incident energy point for each partial wave, but rather distributes all energy points across all processors. This achieves better load-balancing of the work between cores and avoids the case where an overloaded single processor has to always calculate in the energy range where there are approximately the same number of half-open or half-closed channels, which is numerically intensive. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Dimension parameters used to define arrays and matrices within PSTGF (PARAM file) have been removed, all array dimensions are dynamically allocatable based upon the H.DAT file and set to the exact dimension. A CUDA subroutine for matrix multiplications using GPUs has been included, it can be activated or deactivated commenting this module in the source. Users of serial version STGF or older parallel versions of PSTGF can move to current version without any modification in the input files. [1] M.J.

II, Buenos Aires, C1428EHA, Argentina","The calculation of potential energy and free-energy profiles along complex chemical reactions or rare event processes is of great interest because of their importance for many areas in chemistry, molecular biology, and material science. One typical way to generate these profiles is to add a bias potential to modify the energy surface, which can act on a selected degree of freedom in the system. However, in these cases, the quality of the result is strongly dependent on the selection of the degree of freedom over which this bias potential acts. The present work introduces a simple method for the analysis of the degree of freedom selected to describe a chemical process. The proposed methodology is based on the decomposition of contributions to the potential energy profiles by the integration of forces along a reaction path, which allows evaluating the different contributions to the energy change. This could be useful for discriminating the contributions to the energy arising from different regions of the system, which is particularly useful in systems with complex environments that must be represented using hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics schemes. Furthermore, this methodology allows in generating a quick and simple analysis of the degree of freedom which is used to describe the potential energy profile associated with the reactive process. This is computationally more accessible than the corresponding free-energy profile and can therefore be used as a simple estimator of reaction coordinate adequacy.

The systems where they are present include membranes, interfaces, curved spacetime, fluid mechanics, etc. In contrast, the cumbersome aspects of some calculations, sometimes make the use of differential–geometric tools to model systems in curved space, infeasible for practical analytical purposes. In this work, we introduce Surf, a Maple package for differential geometry of surfaces, with functions to ease interdisciplinary modeling in curved systems. The main idea is to have a parameterized surface as input and, as output, a model system on curved surface. The usual operators for a given surface are implemented, so that an arbitrary model can be immediately mapped from flat to curved space. The simplicity of our approach is illustrated with some applications in a variety of interdisciplinary problems: diffusion on a curved space, quantum mechanics on surfaces, and modeling the trajectory of a C. elegans worm. We hope that this package will contribute for easing the implementation of mathematical modeling on surfaces in general.

This process can be applied in many areas of knowledge, such as fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, diffusion on curved surfaces, biology, to name a few. Solution method: The Surf package determines several differential operators and metrics on a surface, such as Laplacian, gradient, mean square displacement, among others. This is done through the symbolic determination of differential operators and metrics, having a parameterized surface as input.

In most cases, the limitations of the targeted quantum hardware have not been taken into account when generating these quantum circuits in the first place. Thus, the technology mapping is likely to induce a considerable overhead for such circuits. In this paper, we consider the realization of reversible circuits consisting of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates on IBM quantum computers. We show that choosing different quantum-level decompositions can indeed have a significant impact on the mapping overhead. Based on this observation, we present an approach to perform design space exploration to obtain quantum circuits with reduced overhead by exploiting information about the targeted quantum hardware as well as the reversible circuit. An experimental evaluation shows that this approach often leads to considerable reductions of the technology mapping overhead with negligible runtime. © 2020 IEEE.","","Cost reduction; Mapping; Qubits; Systems analysis; Timing circuits; Design space exploration; Experimental evaluation; Perform designs; Quantum circuit; Quantum levels; Reversible circuits; Technology mapping; Toffoli gates; Computer circuits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096353396"

In particular, employing this algorithm for feature selection as a wrapper technique in Brain-Computer Interfaces applications was recently proposed with great results. Moreover, the training time of the model was decreased while maintaining a high classification accuracy, both essential conditions for a successful BCI. The drawback of this model was the sensitiveness to changes in the direction and magnitude of the rotation angle, which can produce adverse effects in both performance and convergence time. Chaotic systems and Evolutionary algorithms, when combined, can enhance the convergence rate and speed of the evolutionary process, incrementing the capacity of reaching the global optima. In this paper we explore the effects of adding ergodicity to a QiEA by the employment of chaotic maps in two operators: chaotic uniform crossover and chaotic quantum update gate. To validate the proposed approach, six commonly used chaotic maps are tested with data of Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) of right and left hand movement. The results of these experiments are compared with the ones of a QiEA and a classical Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the proposed model, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is employed as the time-frequency analysis to characterize the signal, whereas a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network is used as a classifier. The results demonstrated that Chaotic QiEAs can significantly improve the convergence time of the model with only a small loss in the final accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","BCI applications; Chaotic maps; Feature selection; Motor Imagery classification; Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm","Chaotic systems; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Lyapunov methods; Multilayer neural networks; Wavelet decomposition; Classification accuracy; Convergence rates; Evolutionary process; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Time frequency analysis; Uniform crossovers; Wavelet Packet Decomposition; Brain computer interface","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092017250"

Instead of tailoring the software to fixed hardware, which is the typical case for writing quantum chemistry code for central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), FPGAs allow us to directly customize the underlying hardware (even at the level of specific electrical signals in the circuit) to give a truly optimized computational performance for quantum dynamics calculations. By offloading the most intensive and repetitive calculations onto an FPGA, we show that the computational performance of our real-time electron dynamics calculations can even exceed that of optimized commercial mathematical libraries running on high-performance GPUs. In addition to this impressive computational speedup, we show that FPGAs are immensely energy-efficient and consume 4 times less energy than modern GPU or CPU architectures. These energy savings are a practical and important metric for supercomputing centers (many of which exceed over $1 million in power costs alone), as exascale computing capabilities become more widespread and commonplace. Taken together, the implementation techniques and performance metrics of our study demonstrate that FPGAs could play a promising role in upcoming quantum chemistry and materials science applications, particularly for the acceleration and energy-efficient execution of quantum dynamics calculations. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","","acceleration; article; calculation; energy conservation; library; materials science; quantum chemistry; running; simulation; software; writing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082957855"

Additionally we incorporate into the semantics a history track which allows reversibility in QML. From the generation and processing of the history track and the final result of a program, the rules for executing reversibility allow to compute the original input data. This work contributes to the study of reversibility in quantum programming languages and considering that there is not yet a quantum computer in which the language can be implemented, this history and the proposed inverse functions are not trivial and allow us to determine that this language is reversible.  © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Programming language; QML; Quantum computation; Quantum programming; Reversibility","Quantum computers; Semantics; Denotational semantics; Input datas; Inverse functions; Quantum data; Quantum programming languages; Computer programming languages","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103455300"

With the possible emergence of large-scale quantum computers several of these problems, such as factoring and computing discrete logarithms, would be efficiently solved. Research on quantum-resistant public-key cryptography, also called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), has been productive in recent years. Public-key cryptosystems based on the problem of computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves appear to be good candidates for the next generation of public-key cryptography standards in the PQC scenario. In this work, motivated by a previous work by D. Moody and D. Shumow [17], we derived maps for elliptic curves represented in Jacobi Intersection and Twisted Hessian models. Our derivation follows a multiplicative strategy that contrasts with the additive idea presented in the Vélu formula. Finally, we present a comparison of computational cost to generate maps for isogenies of degree l, where l = 2k + 1. In affine coordinates, our formulas require 46.8% less computation than the Huff model and 48% less computation than the formulas given for the Extended Jacobi Quartic model when computing isogenies of degree 3. Considering higher degree isogenies as 101, our formulas require 23.4% less computation than the Huff model and 24.7% less computation than the formula for the Extended Jacobi Quartic model. © 2020, American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

In the present work, we propose the usage of reactivity descriptors, theoretical quantities calculated from the electronic structure, to characterize enzymatic catalysis outlining its reaction profile using low-level computational methods, such as semiempirical Hamiltonians. We simulate three enzymatic reactions paths, one containing two reaction coordinates and without prior computational study performed, and calculate the reactivity descriptors for all obtained structures. We observed that the active site local hardness does not change substantially, even more so for the amino-acid residues that are said to stabilize the reaction structures. This corroborates with the theory that activation energy lowering is caused by the electrostatic environment of the active sites. Also, for the quantities describing the atom electrophilicity and nucleophilicity, we observed abrupt changes along the reaction coordinates, which also shows the enzyme participation as a reactant in the catalyzed reaction. We expect that such electronic structure analysis allows the expedient proposition and/or prediction of new mechanisms, providing chemical characterization of the enzyme active sites, thus hastening the process of transforming the resolved protein three-dimensional structures in catalytic information.

Here we demonstrate an exception to this rule using a carefully engineered vectorial light field, and study its non-separability dynamics upon free-space propagation. We show that the local non-separability between the spatial and polarisation degrees of freedom dramatically decays to zero, while preserving the purity of the state and hence the global non-separability.

The focus was on two-party and balanced protocols suitable for the heterogeneity and nondeterministic characteristics of WSNs. The protocols under study offer different security features that might be attractive for different applications depending on the information sensitivity and computing capabilities of the underlying devices. We studied two lightweight key-establishment protocols based on elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), enhanced by the use of other cryptographic constructions, such as ciphers, hash functions, key derivation, and physically unclonable functions (PUFs).

Such schemes are said to be resistant to attacks from quantum computers. With this, the need to start experimenting and implementing with these schemes has arisen. In addition to that, there is a variety of post-quantum cryptographic schemes libraries written in different programming languages and compiled for different architectures. However, in order to a programmer can integrate them into an Android application, it is necessary to compile the source code, perform the integration and test this last one. As a consequence it is not possible to have a ready-To-use library.

Although today this kind of technology is not available and has not reached its full potential, public-key cryptography is at risk since its security depends on problems that classical computers cannot solve in polynomial time, while quantum computers can. Quantum-resistant cryptography has been developed for years, and this work proposes a new implementation that reduces the processing time of XMSS signature generation of SPHINCS+, a stateless scheme designed for digital signature and is in the process of standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States. The proposed implementation has a tradeoff between time and memory space. While original documentation is focused on space optimization, this new implementation needs an additional 20 kB of memory for each tree during the signing process in order to generate a signature but optimizes the time the internal process requires in the authentication path generation, from exponential to linear complexity. Digital signatures generated by both ways are the same. © 2021 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

This key encapsulation mechanism has been included in the list of alternate candidates of the third round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this scheme is assessed in the cold boot attacks setting. In particular, our evaluation is focused on the reference implementation of this scheme. Furthermore, we present a dedicated key-recovery algorithm for SIKE in this setting and show that the key recovery algorithm works for all the parameter sets recommended for this scheme. Moreover, we compute the success rates of our key recovery algorithm through simulations and show the key recovery algorithm may reconstruct the SIKE secret key for any SIKE parameters for a fixed and small α = 0.001 (the probability of a 0 to 1 bit-flipping) and varying values for β (the probability of a 1 to 0 bit-flipping) in the set {0.001, 0.01, …, 0.1}.

The method computes the order r of a random element x in the group Z∗Nand uses that information for splitting N with an application of the greatest common divisor algorithm. However, being probabilistic, the success of Shor's algorithm relies on some special properties of N. If r is even and xr/2£ -1 mod N, then gcd(xr/2- 1, N) reveals a nontrivial factor of N and the method succeeds. But even assuming that r is even and being given the complete prime factorization of N it is not obvious whether xr/2£ -1 mod N and, therefore, it is not easy to assert whether Shor's algorithm would split N without running it and looking at its answer. We present a strategy for detecting whether the splitting occurs without any need for running the quantum order-finding algorithm, but we must be given the prime factorization of N. This has allowed us to produce the first direct evidence of the probability of success of Shor's method. The composites chosen were the product of two randomly-generated probable primes of similar sizes that pass the Miller-Rabin test. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

K777 is an irreversible inhibitor of cruzain, a necessary enzyme for the survival of the Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) parasite, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Despite their importance, irreversible covalent inhibitors are still often avoided due to the risk of adverse effects. Herein, we replaced the K777 vinyl sulfone group with a nitrile moiety to obtain a reversible covalent inhibitor (Neq0682) of cysteine protease. Then, we used advanced experimental and computational techniques to explore details of the inhibition mechanism of cruzain by reversible and irreversible inhibitors. The isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis shows that inhibition of cruzain by an irreversible inhibitor is thermodynamically more favorable than by a reversible one. The hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the mechanism of the reaction inhibition of cruzain by K777 and Neq0682. The calculated free energy profiles show that the Cys25 nucleophilic attack and His162 proton transfer occur in a single step for a reversible inhibitor and two steps for an irreversible covalent inhibitor. The hybrid QM/MM calculated free energies for the inhibition reaction correspond to-26.7 and-5.9 kcal mol-1 for K777 and Neq0682 at the MP2/MM level, respectively. These results indicate that the ΔG of the reaction is very negative for the process involving K777, consequently, the covalent adduct cannot revert to a noncovalent protein-ligand complex, and its binding tends to be irreversible. Overall, the present study provides insights into a covalent inhibition mechanism of cysteine proteases.

Much research focuses on increasing the porosity and pore interconnectivity of ceramic scaffolds to increase osteoconductivity, cell migration and cell-cell interaction. We aimed to fabricate biocompatible 3D-scaffolds featuring macro-and microporous calcium phosphates with high pore interconnection. Nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite (HA) and calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) were synthesized by wet chemical precipitation. Scaffolds were produced from them by the replication polymeric foam technique. Solid content and sintering temperature were varied. Nanoparticles and scaffolds were characterized regarding morphology, chemical and mineral composition, porosity and mechanical properties. Biocompatibility, cell attachment and distribution were evaluated in vitro with human adipose mesenchymal stem cells. Scaffolds with total porosity of 71%–87%, pores in the range of 280–550 µm and connectivity density up to 43 mm−3 were obtained. Smaller pore sizes were obtained at higher sintering temperature. High solid content resulted in a decrease of total porosity but increased interconnectivity. Scaffolds 50HA/50β-TCP featured superior interconnectivity and mechanical properties. They were bioactive and biocompatible. High HA solid content (40 wt.%) in the HA pure scaffolds was negative for cell viability and proliferation, while in the 50HA/50β-TCP composite scaffolds it resulted more biocompatible. © 2019 by the authors.

The Zn(II) binding to SOD1 is critical for the stability of the protein, and has been by itself implicated in ALS pathogenesis. Hence, the quantum mechanical (QM) study of the Zn(II)-site of SOD1 is relevant for understanding ALS. The hybrid QM-molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach commonly employed for the QM study of proteins is highly dependent on the size of the sub-system treated quantum-mechanically. The size of the QM system also determines the computational feasibility of a given method. In the present work, we compare optimized geometries for the metal site and Zn(II) dissociation energies obtained with a QM/MM methodology employing different sizes for the QM sub-system. We find that geometries converge rapidly to RMSDs of around 0.3 Å, and fails to converge further, while a QM system of 480 atoms was required for converging the Zn(II) interaction energy of SOD1 to within 5 kcal*mol−1, and a 611-atoms QM system for a 1 kcal*mol−1 convergence with respect to our reference, 1280 QM-atoms system.

Recently ultrashort pulses with orbital angular momentum have attracted great attention due to their wide field of applications, from super-resolution microcopy, optical tweezers and ultra-fast optical communications to quantum computing and astrophysics. A principal challenge here is the development of robust and effective methods for OAM generation. At the moment few techniques are known to obtain OAM beams in the free space arrangement cylindrical lenses, spiral phase plates or computer-generated holograms have been used. All those techniques imply that pulse is passing through an optical component and thus obtain dispersive broadening. We propose here a method and a device allowing formation of ultrashort optical vortices from an incident ultrashort pulse without its broadening or compensating the pulse chirp acquired previously. Potentially method and device will allow obtain ultrashort vortices shorter than incident pulse. Case study is presented based on spatiooral numerical simulation and analytical modeling.  © 2020 SPIE.","Chirped Mirrors; OAM; Optical Angular Momentum; Optical Vortices; Pulse compression; Spiral Phase Plate; Ultrashort Laser Pulses; Ultrashort optical vortex; Ultrashort vortical pulse","Astrophysics; Optical communication; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Ultrashort pulses; Vortex flow; Computer generated holograms; Cylindrical lens; Nonlinear interactions; Optical components; Orbital angular momentum; Quantum Computing; Spiral phase plates; Ultrashort optical vortices; Optical tweezers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092512860"

In the implementation of edge computing, however, data confidentiality has been raised as a major concern because edge devices may be untrustable. In this paper, we propose a design of secure and efficient edge computing by linear coding. In general, linear coding can achieve data confidentiality by adding random information to the original data before they are distributed to edge devices. To this end, it is important to carefully design code such that the user can successfully decode the final result while achieving security requirements. Meanwhile, task allocation, which selects a set of edge devices to participate in a computation task, affects not only the total resource consumption, including computation, storage, and communication, but also coding design. In this paper, we study task allocation and coding design, two highly-coupled problems in secure coded edge computing, in a unified framework. In particular, we take matrix multiplication, a fundamental building block of many distributed machine learning algorithms, as the representative computation task, and study optimal task allocation and coding design to minimize resource consumption while achieving information-theoretic security. © 2019 IEEE.","Edge computing; Linear coding; Resource consumption; Security; Task allocation","Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum cryptography; Delay-sensitive applications; Distributed machine learning; Fundamental building blocks; Information- theoretic securities; Linear coding; Resource consumption; Security; Task allocation; Edge computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074854985"

Löwdin partitioning is used to perform the two-state reductions necessary to compute the tunneling matrix element between D and A sites. Here, a method of performing donor and acceptor state analysis for a non-orthogonal basis set in both the weak and strong electronic coupling regimes is developed. The electron tunneling current and coupling are obtained in terms of D–A symmetric and antisymmetric interatomic tunneling elements, and are then used to compare pathway models. These interatomic tunneling elements are both proportional to the Green’s function elements of the isolated protein bridge. To facilitate a perturbative treatment of antisymmetric interatomic tunneling currents, we found a well-known expression for the D–A tunneling matrix element in terms of transformed Green’s function matrix elements of the isolated protein bridge. Also, the relationship of the tunneling matrix element to BO pathways is discussed using the symmetric interatomic coupling. Finally, the definition of the average interatomic and atomic pathway coupling allows us obtain the quantum interference between interatomic tunneling pathways. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Pathway models; Protein electron transfer; Two-state approximation for non-orthogonal basis set","Electron Transport; Electrons; Models, Molecular; Models, Theoretical; Proteins; protein; adult; article; electron transport; human; chemistry; electron; molecular model; theoretical model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061600311"

Towards the massive deployment of QKD, embedding it with the telecommunication system is crucially important. Homogenous optical multi-core fibers (MCFs) compatible with spatial division multiplexing (SDM) are essential components for the next-generation optical communication infrastructure, which provides a big potential for co-existence of optical telecommunication systems and QKD. However, the QKD channel is extremely vulnerable due to the fact that the quantum states can be annihilated by noise during signal propagation. Thus, investigation of telecom compatibility for QKD co-existing with high-speed classical communication in SDM transmission media is needed. In this paper, we present analytical models of the noise sources in QKD links over heterogeneous MCFs.

This implementation is based on full-range Rys polynomials with nodes and weights obtained in each thread of a GPU. For high angular moments, the corresponding integral is solved using a one-dimension vertical recurrence relation. Thus, we computed the MEP with minimal approximations. We show that this implementation is stable and very efficient since the time consumed over GPUs is quite small compared with similar implementations over CPUs. The implementation was done by using CUDA-C programming techniques within the Graphics Processing Units for Atoms and Molecules (GPUAM) project, which has been designed to analyze quantum chemistry fields over heterogeneous computational resources.

Several algorithms have been designed and optimized to perform this routine task, and among them, Quality Threshold stands as a very attractive option. This algorithm guarantees that in retrieved clusters no pair of frames will have a similarity value greater than a specified threshold, and hence, a set of strongly correlated frames are obtained for each cluster. In this work, it is shown that various commonly used software implementations are flawed by confusing Quality Threshold with another simplistic well-known clustering algorithm published by Daura et al. (Daura, X.; van Gunsteren, W. F.; Jaun, B.; Mark, A. E.; Gademann, K.; Seebach, D. Peptide Folding: When Simulation Meets Experiment. Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. 1999, 38 (1/2), 236-240). Daura's algorithm does not impose any quality threshold for the frames contained in retrieved clusters, bringing unrelated structural configurations altogether. The advantages of using Quality Threshold whenever possible to explore Molecular Dynamic trajectories is exemplified. An in-house implementation of the original Quality Threshold algorithm has been developed in order to illustrate our comments, and its code is freely available for further use by the scientific community.

By using a digital–analog decomposition of the master equation that rules the system dynamics, it is shown that this approach leads to quantum synchronization between both two-level systems. Moreover, in this digital–analog block decomposition, the fundamental elements of a quantum machine learning protocol can be identified, in which the agent and the environment (learning units) interact through a mediating system, namely, the register. If the algorithm can be additionally equipped with a classical feedback mechanism, which consists of projective measurements in the register, reinitialization of the register state, and local conditional operations on the agent and environment subspace, a powerful and flexible quantum machine learning protocol emerges. Indeed, numerical simulations show that this protocol enhances the synchronization process, even when every subsystem experiences different loss/decoherence mechanisms, and gives the flexibility to choose the synchronization state. Finally, an implementation is proposed, based on current technologies in superconducting circuits. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This scheme extends the any particle molecular orbital (APMO) approach in the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) framework. As a first assessment of the performance of the proposed approach, we estimate the proton affinities (PAs) of seventy amines in the gas phase and the proton binding energies (PBEs) in the gas phase and in an explicitly solvated environment of the sixty-one protons present in the chignolin protein. These calculations are performed with the QM/MM versions of the APMO second-order proton propagator (APMO-PP2) and the APMO extended Koopmans’ theorem (APMO-KT) approaches. Calculated PAs and PBEs show significant reductions in the computational effort with a reduced loss in accuracy. These results suggest that the APMO/MM scheme might be used as a low-cost multi-component alternative for studies of local properties in big molecular systems.

Although several studies have shown that the characteristics of certain classes of materials can be represented with great precision, it is still necessary to improve the methods and strategies in order to achieve more realistic computational modeling. In the present work, strategies are reported in a systematic way for the accurate representation of crystalline systems. The crystalline compound chosen for the study as a case test was BaMoO4, both because of its potential technological application and because of the low accuracy of the simulations previously reported in the literature. The computational models were carried out with the B3LYP and WC1LYP functionals selected from an initial set containing eight hybrid functionals in conjunction with an all-electron basis set. Two different strategies were applied for improving the description of the initial models, both involving atomic basis set optimization and Hartree-Fock exchange percentage adjustment. The results obtained with the two strategies show a precision of structural parameters, band gap energy, and vibrational properties never before presented in theoretical studies of BaMoO4. Finally, a flowchart of good calculation practices is elaborated. This can be of great value for the organization and conduction of calculations in new research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","BaMoO<sub>4</sub>                             ; Basis set optimization; DFT; Quantum computation methodology","Crystalline materials; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Energy gap; Quantum computers; Software design; BaMoO4; Basis set optimization; Computation methodologies; Computational infrastructure; Computational procedures; Computational simulation; Technological applications; Vibrational properties; Computation theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070224628"

Constructing a two-qudit modulo SUM gate, we generate and measure a single-photon state with nonseparability between time and frequency qudits. We then employ this SUM operation on two frequency-bin entangled photons—each carrying two 32-dimensional qudits—to realize a four-party high-dimensional Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state, occupying a Hilbert space equivalent to that of 20 qubits.

Supporting a massive number of connected devices with 5G advanced technologies and innovating new techniques will surely bring tremendous challenges for trust, security and privacy. Therefore, secure mechanisms and protocols are required as the basis for 5G networks to address this security challenges and follow security-by-design but also security-by-operations rules. In this context, new efficient cryptographic protocols and mechanisms are needed in order to design and achieve information sharing and data protection protocols in 5G networks. In the literature, several security schemes based on unproven assumptions of computational complexity and mathematical models were proposed. However, the cryptanalysis is able to break most of the existing proposals in the presence of several weakest links in the designs. Recently, quantum walks (QWs)have been introduced as an excellent mechanism for generating cryptographic keys due to its nonlinear chaotic dynamical performance, high sensitivity to initial control parameters, stability and very large key space theoretically strong enough to resist various known attacks. This paper firstly proposes two efficient hash function mechanisms for 5G networks applications based on QWs, namely QWHF-1 and QWHF-2. Then, based on these hash functions, two efficient security protocols for securing data in 5G network scenario are proposed. Performance analyses and simulation results show that the proposed approaches are characterized with high security, efficiency, and robustness against several well-known attacks which nominate them as excellent candidates for securing 5G applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","5G networks; Authentication; Quantum hash function; Quantum walks; Security protocols","5G mobile communication systems; Authentication; Distributed computer systems; Hash functions; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Quantum efficiency; Queueing networks; Communication technologies; Cryptographic protocols; Dynamical performance; G-networks; Performance analysis; Quantum walk; Security and privacy; Security protocols; Network security","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066424251"

Both proposals, named FAHE1 and FAHE2, are additively homomorphic and have a symmetric nature, meaning that they are useful in scenarios where encryption and decryption are performed by the same entity. This is the case, for example, of encrypted databases stored in a public cloud. We also evaluate the performance of our proposals in comparison with two alternatives displaying additive homomorphism: the traditional Paillier asymmetric cryptosystem, which is not quantum-resistant; and the XPIR algorithm, which is both quantum-resistant and symmetric. Our experimental results show that both solutions provide considerable speed-ups when compared to Paillier. Namely, encryption and decryption with FAHE1 are, respectively, 120 and 25 times faster than Paillier's, while for FAHE2 both operations run more than 1000 times faster. In addition, when compared with a highly optimized XPIR code, our reference implementation remains quite competitive while producing smaller ciphertexts. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","addition; approximate common divisor; fast; Paillier; Partially homomorphic encryption","Additives; Quantum computers; Asymmetric cryptosystem; Ciphertexts; Encrypted database; Encryption and decryption; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic Encryption Schemes; Public clouds; Reference implementation; Cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089706207"

To achieve that, we perform an analysis using the Eisert–Wilkens–Lewenstein protocol for this asymmetric game. The protocol highlights two solutions for the game, which solve the dilemma and satisfy the pareto-optimal definition, unlike previous reports that rely on Nash equilibrium.

Currently, the two main mathematical problems that guarantee security on the Internet are the Integer Factorization Problem and the Discrete Logarithm Problem. However, Shor's quantum algorithm can easily solve both problems. Therefore, research into cryptographic algorithms that run in classical computers and are resistant to quantum computers is extremely necessary. This area is known as post-quantum cryptography and usually studies asymmetric cryptography. By means of asymptotic analysis, the purpose of this paper is to provide an evaluation of security and its performance for the types of cryptographic systems considered safe against quantum attacks in the second-round NIST Post-Quantum Standardization Process, namely isogeny cryptosystems based on supersingular elliptic curves, error correction code-based encryption system, and lattice-based ring learning with errors. We performed a security comparison of Key Agreements protocols based on these three post-quantum cryptographic primitives and compared them with Discrete Logarithm Problem and Integer Factorization Problem. The comparison of security and its performance is presented by security level, the former by complexity analyses to achieve theoretical minimum key sizes, and the latter by simulation to assess a practical performance comparison. In the complexity analysis, as we increase the security level and then the size of the cryptographic keys increases, techniques based on isogeny outperform all other post-quantum algorithms in relation to key sizes at practical security level. In the performance comparison, the results show that the code-based protocol presents the best results among the others.  © 2013 IEEE.","algorithms; asymmetric cryptography; asymptotic analysis; complexity; key agreement; Post-quantum cryptography","Asymptotic analysis; Error correction; Factorization; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic primitives; Discrete logarithm problems; Integer factorization problem; Post quantum cryptography; Security on the internets; Shor's quantum algorithms; Supersingular elliptic curve; Codes (symbols)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089935961"

Nitroimidazole drugs, such as metronidazole and tinidazole, are the only recommended treatment, but cases of resistance represent at least 5%. In case of resistance or therapeutic failure, posology with higher doses is used, culminating in the increase of the toxic effects of the treatment. In this context, the development of new drugs becomes an eminent necessity. Hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) models using nitroimidazole derivatives were generated to discover the relationship between the different chemical structures and the activity against cells and the selectivity against susceptible and resistant strains. One model of each strain was chosen for interpretation, both showed good internal coefficient (q2 LOO values: 0.607 for susceptible strain and 0.646 for resistant strain subsets) and great values in other internal and external validations metrics. From the contribution of fragments to HQSAR models, several differences between the most and least potent compounds were found: 5-nitroimidazole contributes positively while 4-nitroimidazole negatively. QSAR models employing random forest (RF-QSAR) machine learning technique were also built and a robust model was obtained from resistant strain activity prediction (q2 LOO equals to 0.618). The constructed HQSAR and RF-QSAR models were employed to predict the activity of three newly planned nitroimidazole derivatives in the design of new drugs candidates against T. vaginalis strains. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","HQSAR; Machine learning techniques; Metronidazole-resistant Trichomonas vaginalis; Nitroimidazoles derivatives; QSAR; Random forest","Antiprotozoal Agents; Drug Resistance; Nitroimidazoles; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Trichomonas vaginalis; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Molecular graphics; Sewage treatment plants; Strain; 4 nitroimidazole; antitrichomonal agent; metronidazole; nitroimidazole derivative; 4-nitroimidazole; antiprotozoal agent; nitroimidazole derivative; HQSAR; Machine learning techniques; Metronidazole; Nitroimidazoles; QSAR; Random forests; antiprotozoal activity; Article; chemical structure; drug resistance; drug selectivity; hologram quantitative structure activity relationship; hydrogen bond; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum chemistry; random forest; selectivity index; sexually transmitted disease; toxicity; Trichomonas vaginalis; trichomoniasis; drug effect; quantitative structure activity relation; Trichomonas vaginalis; Computational chemistry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065565043"

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a process to solicit, evaluate, and standardize one or more quantum-resistant public key cryptographic schemes. This process originated because quantum computers can exploit quantum mechanical phenomena and solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for classical computers. This kind of mathematical problem is the basis of secure public key cryptography. As a consequence, in a near future quantum computers will be able to break many of the public key schemes currently in use. However, the challenge is especially acute for devices with different architectures. They might not be well equipped to run the new standards and interoperate with existing communication protocols and networks. In this work, we analyze the performance of postquantum schemes in the transport layer security (TLS) protocol considering x86 as the server architecture and x86/ARM architectures as clients. All of them lack cloud computing or virtualized environments. Our analysis considers integrating the implementation of two cryptographic schemes that were successful in the second round of the postquantum standardization process, namely, Dilithium and New Hope. The performance of postquantum schemes in the TLS protocol is statistically analyzed in x86 and ARM architectures, giving the relationships, the effects and the survival of the analysis.  © 2013 IEEE.","ARM architecture; NIST standardization process; postquantum schemes; transport layer security protocol","Crystals; Internet protocols; Public key cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Qubits; Transport Layer; Cryptographic schemes; Mathematical problems; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Public key schemes; Server architecture; Standardization process; Transport layer security protocols; Virtualized environment; Network architecture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097209229"

Establishing such nodes, providing sufficient functionality to represent a building block for emerging quantum technologies, e.g., a quantum computer or quantum repeater, remains a formidable technological challenge. In this review, the authors present a holistic view on such an architecture, including the relevant components, their characterization, and their impact on the overall system performance. The authors present a hardware architecture based on a uniform linear segmented multilayer trap, controlled by a custom-made fast multichannel arbitrary waveform generator. The latter allows for conducting a set of different ion shuttling operations at sufficient speed and quality. The authors describe the relevant parameters and performance specifications for microstructured ion traps, waveform generators, and additional circuitry, along with suitable measurement schemes to verify the system performance. Furthermore, a set of different basic shuttling operations for a dynamic qubit register reconfiguration is described and characterized in detail.  © 2020 Author(s).","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106085806"

Such a specific Micro-Total Analysis Systems (µTAS) can be used in food, cosmetic and biology applications. Such lab-on-chip sensors present the possibility of data treatment with an embedded system. The serial of transduced spectra are then acquired with an optical spectrum analyzer linked to a computer on which Matlab software record and process the data in real time. Then specific quantities can be linked to the intrinsic physico-chemical characteristics of the substances. As an example (not exhaustive) the development and the ability of an optical integrated polymeric resonator, acting as a surface light probe, for monitoring temperature-induced supramolecular phase transitions will be presented. The homogeneous detection of the transitions between different self-assembled structures in an aqueous solution of fatty acids (12-hydroxystearic acid, in association with amino-pentanol) was studied by investigating the coupling between the solution and the integrated photonic micro-cavity. Tuning the self-organized assemblies of surfactant is very attractive for many applications, such as cosmetic products, food, drug delivery and medical, and the development of alternative tools - especially those requiring minute amount of solution - to monitor their structural changes are essential. These original studies at temperatures ranging from 17 to 24 °C, based on a statistical treatment of optical resonance spectra, have evidenced the thermoresponsive nature of the optical features, and that different regimes occur with temperature. The optical results were corroborated with the measurement of the solution viscosity as a function of temperature, confirming that we can ascribe the optically-detected regimes to a surfactant assembly shifting reversibly from a tubular shape to a micellar one. The comparison between the optical and the rheological responses showed different accuracies: while the viscosity data exhibited a rather smooth and monotonous transition, the behavior changes were sharper and non-monotonous in terms of optical properties, allowing us to unambiguously identify in intermediate regime between 18.5 and 20°C. These morphological transition experiments represent a unique opportunity to extend the numbers of available techniques studying these systems through integrated optical techniques with potential opportunities of real time detection and working on low sampling volume. Other examples will be developed as the detecting of phase transition of sphingomyelin in biology and health corroborate by differential scanning calorimetry…. © 2020 SPIE","Fatty acid; Lipid; Micro-total analysis systems; Phase transition; Photonics; Polymers; Sensors; Sphingomyelin","Assembly; Biology; Cosmetics; Differential scanning calorimetry; Drug delivery; Drug products; Fatty acids; Industrial research; Manufacture; MATLAB; Phospholipids; Photonics; Probes; Quantum optics; Real time systems; Solution mining; Spectrum analyzers; Supramolecular chemistry; Surface active agents; Viscosity; 12-Hydroxystearic acid; Dynamics of phase transitions; Homogeneous detections; Micro total analysis systems; Morphological transitions; Optical spectrum analyzer; Physicochemical characteristics; Self assembled structures; Optical properties","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087050170"

The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet, such possibility also brought challenges. One challenge is the so called Qubit Allocation problem: The mapping of a virtual quantum circuit into an actual quantum architecture. There exist solutions to this problem; however, in our opinion, they fail to capitalize on decades of improvements on graph theory. In contrast, this paper shows how to model qubit allocation as the combination of Subgraph Isomorphism and Token Swapping. This idea has been made possible by the publication of an approximative solution to the latter problem in 2016. We have compared our algorithm against five other qubit allocators, all independently designed in the last two years, including the winner of the IBM Challenge. When evaluated in łTokyo"", a quantum architecture with 20 qubits, our technique outperforms these state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the quality of the solutions that it finds and the amount of memory that it uses, while showing practical runtime. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Taking pMHC's structural properties, we assumed that ΔH ≫ -TΔS would generate a linear model for estimating relative free energy change, using three semiempirical quantum methods (PM6, PM7, and FMO-SCC-DFTB3) along with the implicit solvent models, and considering proteins in neutral and charged states.

The BG theory describes amazingly well the thermal equilibrium of a plethora of so-called simple systems. However, BG statistical mechanics and its basic additive entropy SBG started, in recent decades, to exhibit failures or inadequacies in an increasing number of complex systems. The emergence of such intriguing features became apparent in quantum systems as well, such as black holes and other area-law-like scenarios for the von Neumann entropy. In a different arena, the efficiency of the Shannon entropy-as the BG functional is currently called in engineering and communication theory-started to be perceived as not necessarily optimal in the processing of images (e.g., medical ones) and time series (e.g., economic ones). Such is the case in the presence of generic long-range space correlations, long memory, sub-exponential sensitivity to the initial conditions (hence vanishing largest Lyapunov exponents), and similar features. Finally, we witnessed, during the last two decades, an explosion of asymptotically scale-free complex networks. This wide range of important systems eventually gave support, since 1988, to the generalization of the BG theory. Nonadditive entropies generalizing the BG one and their consequences have been introduced and intensively studied worldwide. The present review focuses on these concepts and their predictions, verifications, and applications in physics and elsewhere. Some selected examples (in quantum information, high-and low-energy physics, low-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, earthquakes, turbulence, long-range interacting systems, and scale-free networks) illustrate successful applications. The grounding thermodynamical framework is briefly described as well. © 2020 by the authors.","Beyond boltzmann-gibbs-shannon; Complex systems; Nonadditive entropies; Nonextensive statistical mechanics","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071945927"

To perform the information processing, the polarization and orbital angular momentum of light act as the control and target qubits, respectively. The readout process is simple, requiring only a linear polarizer and a triangular diffractive aperture prior to detection.

Starting from the first two-photon experiment by Hong-Ou-Mandel [1], it has been shown that multiphoton interference lies at the heart of computational complexity in linear optical interferometers, the most notable example being provided by the Boson Sampling model [2]. This model corresponds to sampling from the evolution of n indistinguishable photons in a multimode linear network, and has been shown to be hard to simulate classicaly thus representing a promising route to experimentally reach the quantum advantage regime. It has been shown, however, that genuine multiparticle interference is necessary for high computational complexity.

However, the present communication technologies have several security related issues which is required to provide secure end to end connectivity among services. Moreover, due to recent, rapid growth of quantum technologies, most common security mechanisms considered secure today may be soon imperilled. Thus, the modern security mechanisms during their construction also require the power of quantum technologies to resist various potential attacks from quantum computers. Because of its characteristics, quantum walks (QW) is considered as a universal quantum computation paradigm that can be accepted as an excellent key generator. In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61%, and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks. © 2013 IEEE.","data transfer in IoT; edge computing; image encryption; lightweight cipher; Quantum walks; wireless communication","Data transfer; Internet of things; Pixels; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Random number generation; Communication technologies; Computation paradigms; Encryption algorithms; End-to-end connectivity; Image encryption scheme; Nonlinear dynamic behaviours; Pseudo-random numbers; Quantum technologies; Network security","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085643723"

In this paper we use this technique to estimate quantitative measurements of the rapid growth of a bacteria population dictated by binary fission as well as to make predictions to anticipate and tackle down their possible scenarios of aggregation. We have used the theory of the Feynman diagrams in conjunction to the propagator. The resulting probabilities are interpreted as the ones that allows us to measure the growth of the population under certain physical conditions. Once the formalism is defined, we pass to calculate amplitudes of probability in taking the example 2→2 processes. With the types: termophile and mesophile, we provide various master equations in order to compute the net number of bacteria for a time of up to 20 hours. The final error of the model has been of order of 7.5%.

Within this scenario, with the democratization of data access, the field now encounters several opportunities for data-driven approaches toward chemical and materials problems. Specifically, machine learning methods for predictions of novel materials or properties are being increasingly used with great success. However, black box usage fails in many instances; several technical details require expert knowledge in order for the predictions to be useful, such as with descriptors and algorithm selection. These approaches represent a direction for further developments, notably allowing advances for both developed and emerging countries with modest computational infrastructures.

The first two refer mostly to electronic properties, whereas the last contains all other possible contributions to cell efficiency, importantly including molecular geometrical and topological structures, both within a single molecule as amongst a system of molecules. In order to study the effects of molecular morphology of the heterostructures used in OPVs, molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) are imperative, and therefore parameterization of force fields to account for the description of planarity between aromatic rings, both intra- and inter-molecules, is of key importance. In this work, we present quantum mechanical analysis of geometry for the ground, and singlet and triplet excited states, of two simple prototypical molecules used to parametrize the corresponding force-fields. Central for this parameterization is the assignment of local charges within molecules; we studied and compared six different methods to assign atomic charges. With the parameters obtained, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of nanosystems of these molecules. Planarity effects and comparison between different methods for deriving atomic charges are investigated. These results can be applied in future MDS to interpret and characterize charge-transfer models in molecules suitable for OPV design.

Also, the lack of quality assurance procedures in some countries might have a technology-dependent impact on image quality and dose. The Mexican Secretary of Health owns over 300 mammography units for breast cancer screening, about half of them of CR technology. Wéve investigated the performance of 20 CR and 4 DR units in 13 Mexican States, applying over 30 quality-control tests associated with general equipment performance, X-ray source, automatic exposure control, mean glandular dose (MGD), image receptor and image quality, and display conditions. Tests were applied following international protocols and their compliance criteria. None of the systems passed all the significative tests. For CRs, the worst performance was observed in compensation for breast thickness, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) homogeneity, CDMAM thresholdthickness, sensitivity matching of CR plates, and the presence of artefacts. The worse performance of DRs was in compression force, SNR homogeneity, and artefacts. MGD values agreed with recommendations for 2-7 cm PMMA thickness in 50% of CRs and 75% of DRs. The dominance of quantum noise over other components was evaluated by 4 criteria endorsed by different organizations, and results depended on the applied criterium. Analysis of the maintenance procedures suggested that one explanation for these poor results might be the complex CR technology, where the X-ray generation is controlled by a unit fabricated by one manufacturer and the image generation occurs in a non-integrated unit from a different manufacturer. © 2020 SPIE.","CR mammography; Mammography in Mexico; Noise evaluation; Phantom mean glandular dose; Quality control","Image quality; Medical imaging; Quality assurance; Quantum noise; Radiology; Signal to noise ratio; X rays; Breast cancer screening; Compliance criterion; Equipment performance; Maintenance procedures; Mean glandular dose; Physical performance; Quality assurance procedures; Quality control tests; Quality control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086140342"

Most runtime verification formalisms do not involve a notion of time, either by having inputs at all instants (like LTL or Lola) or by reacting to external events in an event-driven fashion (like MOP). Other formalisms consider notions of real-time, ranging from the collection and periodic processing of events to complex computations of the times at which events exist or are produced (like TeSSLa or Striver). Also, some monitoring languages assume that all inputs and outputs change values at once (synchronous), while others allow changes independently (asynchronous). In this paper we present a unifying view of the event-time and synchronous-asynchronous dimensions in the general setting of SRV. We first prove that the Striver event-based asynchronous language can execute synchronous untimed specifications (written in Lola), and empirically show that this simulation is efficient. We then prove that Lola can simulate real-time Striver monitors under the assumption of the existence of temporal backbones and study two cases: (1) Purely event-driven or when reactions can be precomputed (for example periodic intervals), which results in an efficient simulation but restricted to a fragment. (2) When the time has a minimum quantum: which allows full expressivity but the performance is greatly affected, particularly for sparse input streams. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Computer science; Computers; Asynchronous models; Complex computation; Efficient simulation; Event-based; Event-driven; Input streams; Run-time verification; Time event; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093091498"

The scheme is based on the decisional decoding problem for random quasi-cyclic codes. One problem of the HQC’s reference implementation submitted to NIST in the first round of the standardization process is that the decryption operation is not constant-time. In particular, the decryption time depends on the number of errors decoded by a BCH decoder. We use this to present the first timing attack against HQC. The attack is practical, requiring the attacker to record the decryption time of around 400 million ciphertexts for a set of HQC parameters corresponding to 128 bits of security.

In this work, we propose a method to learn effective state-feedback controllers for nonlinear stochastic control problems based on multilevel importance samplers. In particular, we focus on the question of how to compute effective importance samplers considering a multigrid scenario. We test our algorithm in finite horizon control problems based on Lorenz-96 model with chaotic and non-chaotic behaviour, showing, in all cases, that our multigrid implementation reduces the computational time and improves the effective sample size. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Furthermore, the numerical simulations show that the generation scheme exhibits a collective effect which decreases the generation time in the same proportion as the number of extended cavity increases. Moreover, the entanglement encoded in the photonic states can be transferred towards ancillary two-level systems to generate genuine multipartite entanglement.

Here, we introduce a continuous dynamical decoupling protocol that enables us to protect the entangling gate operation between two qubits from the environmental noise. We present a simple model that involves two qubits which interact with each other with a strength that depends on their mutual distance and generates the entanglement among them, as well as in contact with an environment. The nature of the environment, that is, whether it acts as an individual or common bath to the qubits, is also controlled by the effective distance of qubits. Our results indicate that the introduced continuous dynamical decoupling scheme works well in protecting the entangling operation. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the dynamics of the qubits naturally led them into a decoherence-free subspace which can be used complimentary to the continuous dynamical decoupling. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamical decoupling; Open quantum systems; Quantum control; Quantum gates","Logic gates; Quantum optics; Qubits; Decoherence free subspace; Dynamical decoupling; Entangling operation; Environmental noise; Open quantum systems; Quantum control; Quantum gates; Quantum simulators; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064060313"

The quantum walk algorithm as a search algorithm is quadratically faster than its classic analog. The quantum walk variance is O(t) while the variance of its classic analog is O(√t), where t is the time or iteration.

Ecuador 3493, Santiago, 9170124, Chile","The physical characterization of the chemical bond in the ground state has been a central theme to theoretical chemistry. Among many techniques, quantum chemical topology (QCT) has emerged as a robust technique to understand the features of the chemical bond and electron organization within molecules. One consolidate tool within QCT is the topological analysis of the electron localization function (ELF). Most research on ELF and chemical bond has focused either on singlet ground states or the first excited triplet. However, most photochemical reactions and photophysical processes occur in excited states with the same spin-symmetry as the ground state. In this work, we develop a proposal on how to compute the ELF in excited states of any symmetry within linear-response time-dependent density functional theory. Then, we study the evolution of the chemical bonds in the ground- and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of a prototypal Schiff base (the salicylidene methylamine). We found that the topological analysis of the ELF along reaction paths explains the presence of a barrier for the proton transfer in the ground state and the absence of it in the excited state. Briefly, in the ground state, the cleavage of the O-H bond results in a structure with high electrostatic potential energy due to an excess of electron lone-pairs (3) in the oxygen atom, which explains the barrier. In the excited state, the electronic transition promotes an enhancement of the basicity of nitrogen by allocating three nonbonding electrons in the basin of its lone-pair. This excess of electrons in the N exerts an electrostatic attraction of the proton, which we suggest as the primary driven-force of the barrierless reaction. Because in excited states the molecule can develop more vibrational kinetic energy than in the ground state, we performed an ab initio molecular dynamics of the proton transfer in the excited state and corroborate that our conclusions on the topology of the ELF do not change due to dynamic effects. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072993617"

After defining the control problem cost function, we use a perturbation analysis to compute its differential and formulate an optimality system. After appropriate time discretization of the control problem, we use a conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the discrete analogue of the above optimality system. The methodology we briefly described above has been applied successfully to the current pulse driven transition between two stable equilibrium states. This type of transitions was used in [1–5], to study Read/Write cryogenic memory cell operations based on the dynamics of small Josephson junction arrays.

At present, when the first quantum computers are available, scientists are working to confirm the quantum supremacy in different fields. After almost 20 years that the first metaheuristic inspired in quantum phenomena was published, a large number of works have been proposed. This paper aims to look back to see which quantum-inspired metaheuristics could be translated to be used in the existing quantum computers based on the circuit model programming paradigm. Reviewed metaheuristics were classified according to their main source of inspiration; just some representative works of each classification were selected because of the vast number of existing works on each one. The analysis was done for the circuit model and metrics as width, size, and length were used to determine their viability of being implemented in a real quantum computer. Moreover, comparative results using metrics such as performance and running time for quantum-inspired metaheuristic were included. © 2019 IEEE.","binary coded quantum-inspired metaheuristic; circuit model; metaheuristic for quantum computer; Quantum metaheuristic; quantum-inspired; real coded quantum-inspired metaheuristic","Circuit simulation; Computer programming; Heuristic algorithms; Qubits; Circuit modeling; Meta heuristics; Metaheuristic; Programming paradigms; Quantum phenomena; quantum-inspired; Running time; Computer circuits","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077272382"

In the case of the structured MinRank instances arising in the latter, we build upon a recent breakthrough [11] showing that algebraic attacks outperform the combinatorial ones that were considered state of the art up until now. Through a slight modification of this approach, we completely avoid Gröbner bases computations for certain parameters and are left only with solving linear systems. This does not only substantially improve the complexity, but also gives a convincing argument as to why algebraic techniques work in this case. When used against the second round NIST-PQC candidates ROLLO-I-128/192/256, our new attack has bit complexity respectively 71, 87, and 151, to be compared to 117, 144, and 197 as obtained in [11]. The linear systems arise from the nullity of the maximal minors of a certain matrix associated to the algebraic modeling. We also use a similar approach to improve the algebraic MinRank solvers for the usual MinRank problem. When applied against the second round NIST-PQC candidates GeMSS and Rainbow, our attack has a complexity that is very close to or even slightly better than those of the best known attacks so far. Note that these latter attacks did not rely on MinRank techniques since the MinRank approach used to give complexities that were far away from classical security levels. © 2020, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Algebraic attack; NIST-PQC candidates; Post-quantum cryptography; Rank metric code-based cryptography","Cryptography; Linear systems; Security of data; Algebraic attack; Algebraic modeling; Algebraic techniques; Bit complexity; Rank metric codes; Security level; State of the art; Algebra","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097831317"

Thus, a realistic confinement potential of an electron dot which is composed of a very high rectangular potential well of width approximately equal to three orders of magnitude of the electron dot Compton wavelength (one nanometer) is proposed here.

Nowadays, the unique electrical characteristics associated with them, concerning nanoscale dimensions, nonvolatility, andCMOSBEOL integration compatibility, along with the advantages of crossbar structures, have the potential to revolutionize computing architectures. Being associated with the totally nonlinear behavior of individual memristive elements, circuits of multiple memristors may work in very complicatedway, quite difficult to predict, due to the polarity-dependent nonlinear variation in the memory resistance (memristance) of individual memristors. A well defined and effective memristor model for circuit design combined with a design paradigm which exploits the composite memristance of the resistive switching elements, based on well understood underlying logic design principles, would certainly accelerate research on new computing schemes using nanoscale circuits and systems. Towards this goal, we explore the dynamics of regular network geometries containing only memristive devices and present a memristor crossbar circuit design paradigm in which memristors are modeled using the quantum mechanical phenomenon of tunneling. We use this circuit model to test various logic circuit designs capable of universal computation. Finally, we develop and present a novel CMOS-like design paradigm for memristor-based crossbar circuits. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084879866"

In this manner we focus on the description of the potential transactions using entirely the formalism of quantum mechanics.

Among the effective and modern sunscreens, triazine compounds are known as an important class based on their physical-chemical properties, such as photostability and UV broad-spectrum absorption (UVA and UVB). Molecular modeling and quantum mechanical calculations approaches can be helpful to orientate the design of sunscreens. Herein, a case study is presented to demonstrate the importance of the molecular modeling as a design tool for promising sunscreen candidates based on the synthesis research previously described of bemotrizinol, a broad-spectrum photostable organic UV filter present in many sunscreens products. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations performed in gas phase on the isolated organic UV filters proved to reproduce the experimental UV absorption, guiding the choice of the most efficient candidate as sunscreen. The present work highlights the importance of molecular modeling as an effective tool to support synthesis research, increasing the possibility of obtaining promising compounds with reduced costs and effluent production.

In fact, it has the potential to reach near quantum-limited noise on a wider bandwidth, larger dynamic range and higher operation frequency when compared with current technologies. While the first implementation of a TKIPA used a coplanar waveguide for the transmission line [1], in this work, we present simulation studies using a microstrip line. One of the main motivations is to be able to obtain a 50-Ω line suitable for readily connection with other components. Therefore, reducing the reflections produced by an impedance mismatch between the ports. In this work we present the design of two different 50-Ω microstrip engineered transmission lines for parametric amplification using the four- and three-wave mixing effects. Additionally, we have included losses in the model. We have simulated their dispersion relation, and the parametric gain with pump frequencies at 7 and 14 GHz for the four- and three-wave mixing effects, respectively. We demonstrate that the three-wave mixing process requires less pumping power for obtaining the same gain with the added advantage of not having a stop band within the operation range. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate that three-wave mixing is less affected by losses on the transmission line. © ISSTT 2019 - 30th International Symposium on Space Terahertz Technology, Proceedings Book.

Indeed, these underlying statistical fluctuations of light are associated with the fundamental physical processes behind their generation. In this contribution, we experimentally demonstrate that the manipulation of the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of two-mode squeezed vacuum states leads to a family of quantum-correlated multiphoton states with tunable mean photon numbers and degree of correlation. Our technique relies on the use of conditional measurements to engineer the excitation mode of the field through the simultaneous subtraction of photons from two-mode squeezed vacuum states. The experimental generation of nonclassical multiphoton states by means of photon subtraction unveils novel mechanisms to control fundamental properties of light. As a remarkable example, we demonstrate the engineering of a quantum state of light with up to ten photons, exhibiting nearly Poissonian photon statistics, that constitutes an important step towards the generation of entangled lasers. Our technique enables a robust protocol to prepare quantum states with multiple photons in high-dimensional spaces and, as such, it constitutes a novel platform for exploring quantum phenomena in mesoscopic systems. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Laser theory; Light; Photons; Quantum optics; Statistical mechanics; Conditional measurements; Degree of correlations; Electromagnetic fluctuations; Fundamental properties; High dimensional spaces; Photon subtractions; Statistical fluctuations; Two-mode squeezed vacuum state; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074108879"

Since the technique depends considerably on this l, research efforts have been estimating the optimal value for different scenarios, including 2D grids with multiple solutions. However, specifically two previous works have used different stopping conditions for the simulations. Here, firstly, we show that these stopping conditions are not interchangeable. After doing such a pending investigation to define the stopping condition properly, we analyze the impacts of multiple solutions on the final results achieved by the technique, which is the main contribution of this work. In doing so, we demonstrate that the success probability is inversely proportional to the density of vertices marked as solutions and directly proportional to the relative distance between solutions. These relations presented here are guaranteed only for high values of the input parameters because, from different points of view, we show that a disturbed transition range exists in the small values. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Quantum computing; Quantum walk; Search algorithm","Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Graph search algorithm; Input parameter; Multiple solutions; Optimal values; Quantum walk; Relative distances; Research efforts; Search Algorithms; Graph algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094112772"

As a variant of the McEliece scheme, it is based on the syndrome decoding problem, which is a hard problem from Coding Theory. Its key sizes are competitive with the ones of the widely used RSA cryptosystem, and it came with an apparently strong security reduction. For three years, the scheme has not suffered major threats, until the end of 2016, at the Asiacrypt, when Guo, Johansson, and Stankovski presented a reaction attack on the QC-MDPC that exploits one aspect that was not considered in the security reduction: The probability of a decoding failure to occur is lower when the secret key and the error used for encryption share certain properties. Recording the decoding failures, the attacker obtains information about the secret key and then use the information gathered to reconstruct the key. Guo et al. presented an algorithm for key reconstruction for which we can point two weaknesses. The first one is that it cannot deal with partial information about the secret key, resulting in the attacker having to send a large number of decoding challenges. The second one is that it does not scale well for higher security levels. To improve the attack, we propose a key reconstruction algorithm that runs faster than Guo's et al. algorithm, even using around 20% less interactions with the secret key holder than used by their algorithm, considering parameters suggested for 80 bits of security. It also has a lower asymptotic complexity which makes it scale much better for higher security parameters. The algorithm can be parallelized straightforwardly, which is not the case for the one by Guo et al. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Post-quantum cryptography; QC-MDPC McEliece; Reaction attack","Computer programming; Public key cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Asymptotic complexity; McEliece; Partial information; Post quantum cryptography; Public-key encryption scheme; Reaction attack; Reconstruction algorithms; Security parameters; Decoding","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054649490"

The problem under consideration includes the presence of constant damping along with anomalous spatial derivatives. The model is defined on a close and bounded interval of the real line, and it is at rest at the initial time. One end of the interval is subject to sinusoidal driving, and the other considers the presence of an absorbing boundary in order to simulate a semi-infinite medium. The simulation of this system is carried out using a numerical method that resembles the energy properties of the continuous medium. The computational results shown in this work establish the presence of the nonlinear phenomenon of bistability in the system considered. We obtain hysteresis cycles for some particular scenarios, and employ the bistability of the system to simulate the transmission of binary signals from the driving boundary to the opposite end. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","anomalous diffusion; Computational simulation; double sine-Gordon regime; nonlinear bistability; nonlinear wave equation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049570781"

This perspective suggests that, even in the case of quantum algorithms, the control flow notions of sequencing, conditionals, loops, and recursion are entirely classical. There is however, another notion of control flow, that is itself quantum. The notion of quantum conditional expression is reasonably well-understood: the execution of the two expressions becomes itself a superposition of executions. The quantum counterpart of loops and recursion is however not believed to be meaningful in its most general form. In this paper, we argue that, under the right circumstances, a reasonable notion of quantum loops and recursion is possible. To this aim, we first propose a classical, typed, reversible language with lists and fixpoints. We then extend this language to the closed quantum domain (without measurements) by allowing linear combinations of terms and restricting fixpoints to structurally recursive fixpoints whose termination proofs match the proofs of convergence of sequences in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We additionally give an operational semantics for the quantum language in the spirit of algebraic lambda-calculi and illustrate its expressiveness by modeling several common unitary operations. © The Author(s) 2018.","","Biomineralization; Computation theory; Computational mechanics; Hilbert spaces; Pattern matching; Quantum theory; Semantics; Conditional expressions; Convergence of sequence; Infinite dimensional; Linear combinations; Operational semantics; Quantum algorithms; Quantum counterpart; Symmetric patterns; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045645899"

Algorithms represented by this model consist of a set of unitary operators acting over a finite Hilbert space, and a final measurement step consisting of a set of projectors. In this work, we prove that the application of these unitary operators before the measurement step is equivalent to decomposing a unit vector into a sum of vectors and then inverting some of their relative phases. We also prove that the vectors of that sum must fulfill a list of properties and we call such vectors a Block Set. If we define the measurement step for the Block Set Formulation similarly to the Quantum Query Model, then we prove that both formulations give the same Gram matrix of output states, although the Block Set Formulation allows a much more explicit form. Therefore, the Block Set reformulation of the Quantum Query Model gives us an alternative interpretation of how quantum algorithms work. Finally, we apply our approach to the analysis and complexity of quantum exact algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Analysis of algorithms; Computational complexity; Design of algorithms; Quantum exact algorithms; Quantum query complexity","Computational complexity; Vectors; Analysis of algorithms; Design of algorithms; Exact algorithms; Quantum algorithms; Quantum queries; Quantum query complexity; Relative phasis; Unitary operators; Quantum theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044318211"

In the present work, we extend the QCKD theory in two ways: Firstly, we propose to use the dependent Bernoulli trials to model the key generation in QCKD. Using this model, we show that the key generated by QCKD is far from presenting the observed correlations in chaos-based cryptography, and it is very close to the maximum secrecy offered by ideal quantum cryptography. Secondly, we show a new optical scheme for QCKD in which the optical chaotic scheme using optoelectronic oscillators is substituted by nonlinear discrete equations running in computers and the information carrier used is the phase instead of the light polarization. These changes make much easier its implementation with today technology while keeping the same security level guaranteed by chaotic and quantum rules. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chaos; Quantum key distribution; Security","Chaos theory; Fiber optic networks; Nonlinear equations; Optoelectronic devices; Chaos-based cryptography; Dependent Bernoulli trials; Discrete equations; Information carriers; Key distribution; Opto-electronic oscillator; Security; Security level; Quantum cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055319073"

The chemical reactivity of these derivatives has been interpreted using quantum descriptors such as frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO), Hirshfeld charges, molecular electrostatic potential, and the dual descriptor [Δ f(r) ]. These descriptors are directly related to experimental median lethal dose (LD 50) , expressed as its decimal logarithm [Aobs= log 10(LD 50) ] through a multiple linear regression equation. The proposed model predicts the toxicity of phosphonates in function of the volume (V), the load of the most electronegative atom of the molecule (q), and the eigenvalue of the molecular orbital HOMO (EHOMO). The obtained values in the internal validation of the model are: R2= 82.71 %, RADJ2=80.24%, F= 33.5 , δK= 0.169 , δQ= 0.011 , RP= 0.423 , RN=-0.025(-0.311), and Qboot2=75.45%. The toxicity of nine phosphonate derivatives used as test molecules was adequately predicted by the model. The theoretical results indicate that the oxygen atom of the O=P group plays an important role in the interaction mechanism between the phosphonate and the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, inhibiting the removal of the proton of the ser-200 residue by the his-440 residue. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Acetylcholinesterase; DFT; LD <sub>50</sub>                         ; Phosphonates; QSAR; QSPR; Quantum chemical descriptor; Toxicity","Computer Simulation; Electrons; Lethal Dose 50; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Organophosphonates; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; phosphonic acid derivative; phosphonic acid derivative; Article; chemical bond; chemical structure; electrical parameters; LD50; linear regression analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; physical chemistry; physical parameters; prediction; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; toxicity testing; toxicological parameters; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; electron; molecular model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043469282"

A finite-difference discretization of the model is provided using fractional centered differences. The method is a technique that is capable of preserving an energy-like quantity at each iteration. Some computational comparisons against solutions available in the literature are performed in order to assess the capability of the method to preserve the invariant. Our experiments confirm that the technique yields good approximations to the solutions considered. As an application of our scheme, we provide simulations that confirm, for the first time in the literature, the presence of the phenomenon of nonlinear supratransmission in Riesz space-fractional Klein–Gordon equations driven by a harmonic perturbation at the boundary. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy-preserving finite-difference scheme; Nonlinear relativistic wave equation; Nonlinear supratransmission; Riesz space-fractional derivatives","Finite difference method; Iterative methods; Quantum theory; sine-Gordon equation; Computational comparisons; Finite difference scheme; Finite-difference discretization; Fractional derivatives; Nonlinear supratransmission; Nonlinear wave equation; Relativistic quantum mechanics; Relativistic wave equations; Nonlinear equations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036615303"

It exploits the unique technique, among Cosmic Microwave Background experiments, of bolometric interferometry, combining together the sensitivity of bolometric detectors with the control of systematic effects typical of interferometers. QUBIC will perform sky observations in polarization, in two frequency bands centered at 150 and 220 GHz, with two kilo-pixel focal plane arrays of NbSi Transition-Edge Sensors (TES) cooled down to 350 mK. A subset of the QUBIC instrument, the so called QUBIC Technological Demonstrator (TD), with a reduced number of detectors with respect to the full instrument, will be deployed and commissioned before the end of 2018. The voltage-biased TES are read out with Time Domain Multiplexing and an unprecedented multiplexing (MUX) factor equal to 128. This MUX factor is reached with two-stage multiplexing: a traditional one exploiting Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) at 1K and a novel SiGe Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) at 60 K. The former provides a MUX factor of 32, while the latter provides a further 4. Each TES array is composed of 256 detectors and read out with four modules of 32 SQUIDs and two ASICs. A custom software synchronizes and manages the readout and detector operation, while the TES are sampled at 780 Hz (100kHz/128 MUX rate). In this work we present the experimental characterization of the QUBIC TES arrays and their multiplexing readout chain, including time constant, critical temperature, and noise properties. © 2018 SPIE.","Bolometric Interferometry; CMB instrumentation; Cosmic Microwave Background; SiGe ApplicationSpecific Integrated Circuit; Superconducting QUantum Interference Device; the QUBIC experiment; TimeDomain Multiplexing; Transition-Edge Sensor","Application specific integrated circuits; Bolometers; Cosmology; Infrared detectors; Interferometers; Interferometry; Microwave sensors; Molluscs; Nanosensors; Niobium compounds; Quantum interference devices; Shellfish; SQUIDs; Superconducting devices; Bolometric Interferometry; CMB instrumentation; Cosmic microwave backgrounds; Time domain; Transition-edge sensors; Si-Ge alloys","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051975064"

Surprisingly it turned out recently to be of importance in medical and biological environments, in search of role of hydrogen as radical scavenger participating in the human body: water is supposed to be of possible influence in this reaction. However, there are no theoretical studies considering solvent effects in the title reaction which in the gas phase is slow. Here, we aim to analyze the H2 + OH reaction with a blend of electronic structure calculations and the deformed Transition-State Theory (TST) approach. Inclusion of the continuum solvation model density (SMD) was applied for mimicking the role of the aqueous phase. Preliminary results demonstrate an enormous increase in the reactivity between H2 and OH molecules in water environment, approximately 150- and 138-fold at 25 ℃ and 36.5 ℃, respectively. We expect that these results can help to shed new light on the understanding of the H2 + OH reaction in aqueous phase, paving the way to research for medical and technological applications. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Blending; Computation theory; Electronic structure; Gases; Hydrogen; Quantum chemistry; Solvents; Aqueous environment; Biological environments; Continuum solvation models; Electronic structure calculations; Elementary reaction; Radical scavengers; Technological applications; Transition state theories; Quantum theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068600461"

While this technological evolution resulted in many benefits to our society, it has also posed, along the way, countless challenges that we have yet to surpass. In this paper, we address major challenges from areas that most afflict the UbiComp revolution: 1.Software Protection: weakly typed languages, polyglot software, and networked embedded systems.2.Long-term Security: recent advances in cryptanalysis and quantum attacks.3.Cryptography Engineering: lightweight cryptosystems and their secure implementation.4.Resilience: issues related to service availability and the paramount role of resilience.5.Identity Management: requirements to identity management with invisibility.6.Privacy Implications: sensitivity data identification and regulation.7.Forensics: trustworthy evidence from the synergy of digital and physical world.

It comes from a real refinery where the scheduling starts on the offloading of ships, encompasses terminal and refinery tanks, a crude pipeline, and finishes on the output streams of the crude distillation units. We propose a new approach for the Quantum-Inspired Grammar-based Linear Genetic Programming (QIGLGP) evolutionary algorithm to handle the multiple objectives of the problem using the nondominance concept. The modifications are concentrated on the population updating and sorting steps of QIGLGP. We tackle difference of importance among the objectives using the principle of violation of constraints. The problem constraints define if an instruction will or not be executed but do not affect the violation equation of the objectives. The individuals which have objective values under a pre-defined upper limit are better ranked. Results from five scenarios showed that the proposed model was able to significantly increase the percentage of runs with acceptable solutions, achieving success ratio of 100% in 3 cases and over 70% in 2 other ones. They also show that the Pareto front of these accepted runs contains a set of non-dominated solutions that could be analyzed by the decision maker for his a posteriori decision. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Crude oil refinery scheduling; Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm; Quantum-Inspired Genetic Programming","Crude oil; Decision making; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Petroleum refineries; Refining; Scheduling; Crude distillation units; Crude oil scheduling; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms; Linear genetic programming; Multi-objective problem; Nondominated solutions; Oil refineries; Violation of constraints; Genetic programming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051470507"

To that end, we are guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory for microscopic entities, which unlike classical objects cannot be fully represented in our spatial theater. We suggest that a similar construction needs to be carried out by linguists and computational scientists, to capture the full meaning carried by collections of documental entities. More precisely, we show how to associate a quantum-like ‘entity of meaning’ to a ‘language entity formed by printed documents’, considering the latter as the collection of traces that are left by the former, in specific results of search actions that we describe as measurements. In other words, we offer a perspective where a collection of documents, like the Web, is described as the space of manifestation of a more complex entity – the QWeb – which is the object of our modeling, drawing its inspiration from previous studies on operational-realistic approaches to quantum physics and quantum modeling of human cognition and decision-making. We emphasize that a consistent QWeb model needs to account for the observed correlations between words appearing in printed documents, e.g., co-occurrences, as the latter would depend on the ‘meaning connections’ existing between the concepts that are associated with these words. In that respect, we show that both ‘context and interference (quantum) effects’ are generally required to explain all possible probabilities calculated by counting the relative number of documents containing certain words and co-occurrences of words. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conceptual entities; Context effect; Information retrieval; Interference effects; Quantum structures; World Wide Web","Clustering algorithms; Computation theory; Decision making; Information retrieval; Quantum theory; Collection of documents; Computational scientists; Conceptual entities; Context effects; Interference effects; Language entities; Printed documents; Quantum structure; World Wide Web","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044269630"

The goal is to calculate the smallest (“ground state”) eigenvalue of the stationary Schrödinger equation which here is a two-dimensional Helmholtz equation, ψxx+ψyy+Eψ=0 where E is the eigenvalue and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the walls of the waveguide. Perturbation theory gives a good description when the “bending strength” parameter ϵ is small as described in our previous article (Amore et al., 2017) and other works cited therein. However, such series are asymptotic, and it is often impractical to calculate more than a handful of terms. It is therefore useful to develop numerical methods for the perturbed strip to cover intermediate ϵ where the perturbation series may be inaccurate and also to check the pertubation expansion when ϵ is small. The perturbation-induced change-in-eigenvalue, δ≡E(ϵ)−E(0), is O(ϵ2). We show that the computation becomes very challenging as ϵ→0 because (i) the ground state eigenfunction varies on both O(1) and O(1∕ϵ) length scales and (ii) high accuracy is needed to compute several correct digits in δ, which is itself small compared to the eigenvalue E. The multiple length scales are not geographically separate, but rather are inextricably commingled in the neighborhood of the boundary deformation. We show that coordinate mapping and immersed boundary strategies both reduce the computational domain to the uniform strip, allowing application of pseudospectral methods on tensor product grids with tensor product basis functions. We compared different basis sets; Chebyshev polynomials are best in the cross-channel direction. However, sine functions generate rather accurate analytical approximations with just a single basis function. In the down-channel coordinate, X∈[−∞,∞], Fourier domain truncation using the change of coordinate X=sinh(Lt) is considerably more efficient than rational Chebyshev functions TBn(X;L). All the spectral methods, however, yielded the required accuracy on a desktop computer. © 2017","Pseudospectral; Quantum waveguide","Bending strength; Boundary conditions; Computation theory; Ground state; Numerical methods; Perturbation techniques; Polynomials; Rational functions; Tensors; Waveguides; Analytical approximation; Chebyshev polynomials; Computational domains; Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions; Pseudospectral; Pseudospectral methods; Quantum wave guides; Two-dimensional rectangular; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033797866"

The program adopts atom-centered Gaussian-type functions as a basis set, which makes it possible to perform all-electron as well as pseudopotential calculations. Systems of any periodicity can be treated at the same level of accuracy (from 0D molecules, clusters and nanocrystals, to 1D polymers, helices, nanorods, and nanotubes, to 2D monolayers and slab models for surfaces, to actual 3D bulk crystals), without any artificial repetition along nonperiodic directions for 0–2D systems. Density functional theory calculations can be performed with a variety of functionals belonging to several classes: local-density (LDA), generalized-gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, global hybrid, range-separated hybrid, and self-consistent system-specific hybrid. In particular, hybrid functionals can be used at a modest computational cost, comparable to that of pure LDA and GGA formulations, because of the efficient implementation of exact nonlocal Fock exchange. Both translational and point-symmetry features are fully exploited at all steps of the calculation, thus drastically reducing the corresponding computational cost. The various properties computed encompass electronic structure (including magnetic spin-polarized open-shell systems, electron density analysis), geometry (including full or constrained optimization, transition-state search), vibrational properties (frequencies, infrared and Raman intensities, phonon density of states), thermal properties (quasi-harmonic approximation), linear and nonlinear optical properties (static and dynamic [hyper]polarizabilities), strain properties (elasticity, piezoelectricity, photoelasticity), electron transport properties (Boltzmann, transport across nanojunctions), as well as X-ray and inelastic neutron spectra. The program is distributed in serial, parallel, and massively parallel versions.

The need of a true random sequence of numbers is strategic for a variety of applications, ranging from the game industry to cryptography. Physical sources that rely on natural phenomena spanning radioactive decay, chaotic oscillators, thermal and quantum noise have their own merit, but for the purposes of integration, attributes such as bandwidth and power consumption, need to be accounted for.

This methodology allows one to study dispersion beyond its more narrow definition in long-range Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory. The interacting quantum atoms (IQA) method was applied to MP2/6-31G(d,p) (uncontracted) wave functions of a wide variety of systems: glycine…water (hydration), the ethene dimer (π-π interactions), benzene (aromaticity), cyclobutadiene (antiaromaticity), and NH3BH3 (dative bond). Through the study of molecular complexes it turns out that dispersion energy is either important to a system’s stabilization (for the C2H4 dimer) or not important (for Gly…H2O). We have also discovered that the delocalization in benzene lowers the strength of Coulomb repulsion in the bonds, which has been quantified for the first time through IQA. Finally, we showed that the nature of the dative bond is much different from that of a regular covalent bond as it is not destabilized by electronic correlation. Finally, the conclusions obtained for these archetypical systems have implications for the future of the quantum topological force field FFLUX in the simulation of larger systems.

The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet, quantum programming still lacks the compiler support that modern programming languages enjoy today. To use universal quantum computers like IBM’s, programmers must design low-level circuits. In particular, they must map logical qubits into physical qubits that need to obey connectivity constraints. This task resembles the early days of programming, in which software was built in machine languages. In this paper, we formally introduce the qubit allocation problem and provide an exact solution to it. This optimal algorithm deals with the simple quantum machinery available today; however, it cannot scale up to the more complex architectures scheduled to appear. Thus, we also provide a heuristic solution to qubit allocation, which is faster than the current solutions already implemented to deal with this problem. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","CNOT; Quantum Computer; Qubit Allocation","Logic gates; Machinery; Optimization; Problem oriented languages; Quantum computers; Allocation problems; CNOT; Complex architectures; Connectivity constraints; Heuristic solutions; Quantum processors; Quantum programming; Qubit Allocation; Program compilers","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052761859"

Following this path, our previous DFT studies attributed the origin of unique conformational characteristics of right-handed Watson-Crick duplexes (WCDs) to the conformational profile of deoxydinucleoside monophosphates (dDMPs) serving as the minimal repeating units of DNA strand. According to those findings, the directionality of the sugar-phosphate chain and the characteristic ranges of dihedral angles of energy minima combined with the geometric differences between purines and pyrimidines determine the dependence on base sequence of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of WCDs. This work extends our computational study to complementary deoxydinucleotide-monophosphates (cdDMPs) of non-standard conformation, including those of Z-family, Hoogsteen duplexes, parallel-stranded structures, and duplexes with mispaired bases. For most of these systems, except Z-conformation, computations closely reproduce experimental data within the tolerance of characteristic limits of dihedral parameters for each conformation family. Computation of cdDMPs with Z-conformation reveals that their experimental structures do not correspond to the internal energy minimum. This finding establishes the leading role of external factors in formation of the Z-conformation. Energy minima of cdDMPs of non-Watson-Crick duplexes demonstrate different sequence-dependence features than those known for WCDs. The obtained results provide evidence that the biologically important regularities of 3D structure distinguish WCDs from duplexes having non-Watson-Crick nucleotide pairing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conformation of biopolymers; Density functional theory; Molecular mechanics; Quantum mechanics computations; Sequence dependence","Computer Simulation; DNA; Models, Molecular; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Quantum Theory; deoxydinucleotide monophosphate; DNA; DNA fragment; double stranded DNA; hydrogen; metodiclorofen; oligonucleotide; phosphate; unclassified drug; DNA; Article; conformational transition; density functional theory; DNA conformation; DNA determination; DNA recombination; DNA sequence; DNA structure; molecular mechanics; priority journal; quantum mechanics; structure analysis; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; molecular model; quantum theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041386473"

To ensure adaptivity, i.e. stabilization of the interferometer operation point, we utilize the phase memory of a two-level quantum system, resonantly illuminated with the information bearing signal wave. Phase modulation of the transmitted signal wave transforms into the intensity modulation via interference with the collinearly propagating dipole radiation of the excited two-level system. The latter acts like a reference wave since it has a phase corresponding to that of the signal wave but averaged over the transverse relaxation time T2 of the quantum system. Experimental demonstration with the acetylene-filled hollow-core micro-structured optical fiber at the communication wavelength of 1530nm of the acetylene P9 absorption line is presented. It is shown that the response to the introduced phase modulation is quadratic when the acetylene inhomogeneously broadened absorption line is excited in its center and is a linear one if it is excited at one of the absorption line sides. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The low-profile and low-weight characteristics of FSRs have been exploited in the manufacturing of pressure-mapping insoles. However, FSRs exhibit low repeatability which limits the extensive usage of such devices in certain applications that require high levels of accuracy and repeatability. In order to enhance the performance of FSRs, a custom-designed insole has been manufactured from commercial FSRs. The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of the sourcing voltage (Vs) and the driving circuit on the repeatability of pressure measurements when collecting gait data. It was found that setting a low Vs improves the repeatability of the system, whereas setting a large sourcing voltage causes a degradation of sensors' sensitivity. Some possible reasons for sensitivity degradation are discussed on the basis of modelling sensor dynamics with equations for quantum tunneling conduction and constriction resistance.

The active site of SphK1 is a complex system and the ligands under the study possess a significant conformational flexibility; therefore for our study we performed extended simulations and proper clusterization process. The two theoretical approaches used here, hydrogen bond dynamics propensity analysis and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) calculations, exhibit excellent correlations with the experimental data. In the case of the hydrogen bond dynamics propensity analysis, it is remarkable that a rather simple methodology with low computational requirements yields results in excellent accord with experimental data. In turn QTAIM calculations are much more computational demanding and are also more complex and tedious for data analysis than the hydrogen bond dynamic propensity analysis. However, this greater computational effort is justified because the QTAIM study, in addition to giving an excellent correlation with the experimental data, also gives us valuable information about which parts or functional groups of the different ligands are those that should be replaced in order to improve the interactions and thereby to increase the affinity for SphK1. Our results indicate that both approaches can be very useful in order to predict the inhibiting effect of new compounds before they are synthesized. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hydrogen bond dynamic propensity analysis; QTAIM calculations; Sphingosine kinase inhibitors; Theoretical approaches","Catalytic Domain; Hydrogen Bonding; Kinetics; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Protein Binding; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Quantum Theory; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thermodynamics; Computation theory; Enzymes; Forecasting; Hydrogen bonds; Molecular modeling; Quantum theory; dopamine 2 receptor; ligand; sphingosine kinase 1; ligand; phosphotransferase; protein binding; protein kinase inhibitor; sphingosine kinase; Hydrogen bond dynamic propensity analyse; Hydrogen bond dynamics; Inhibitory effect; Kinase inhibitors; Quantum theory of atom in molecule calculation; Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules; Sphingosine kinase; Sphingosine kinase inhibitor; Theoretical approach; Theoretical modeling; Article; binding affinity; binding site; bioassay; calculation; comparative study; complex formation; controlled study; enantiomer; generalized born surface area; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; ligand binding; methodology; molecular dynamics; molecular model; poisson boltzmann surface area; prediction; priority journal; quantitative study; quantum theory; quantum theory of atoms in molecules calculation; racemic mixture; surface area; theoretical model; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; enzyme active site; hydrogen bond; kinetics; molecular docking; procedures; structure activity relation; thermodynamics; Ligands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049561990"

In this article, we propose an algorithm based on Grover’s adaptative search for multiobjective optimization problems where access to the objective functions is given via two different quantum oracles. The proposed algorithm, considering both types of oracles, are compared against NSGA-II, a highly cited multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm.

One salient feature of the SIDH protocol is that it requires exceptionally short key sizes. However, the latency associated to SIDH is higher than the ones reported for other post-quantum cryptosystem proposals. Aiming to accelerate the SIDH runtime performance, we present in this work several algorithmic optimizations targeting both elliptic-curve and field arithmetic operations. We introduce in the context of the SIDH protocol a more efficient approach for calculating the elliptic curve operation $P+[k]Q$. Our strategy achieves a factor 1.4 speedup compared with the popular variable-three-point ladder algorithm regularly used in the SIDH shared secret phase. Moreover, profiting from pre-computation techniques our algorithm yields a factor 1.7 acceleration for the computation of this operation in the SIDH key generation phase. We also present an optimized evaluation of the point tripling formula, and discuss several algorithmic and implementation techniques that lead to faster field arithmetic computations. A software implementation of the above improvements on an Intel Skylake Core i7-6700 processor gives a factor 1.33 speedup against the state-of-the-art software implementation of the SIDH protocol reported by Costello-Longa-Naehrig in CRYPTO 2016. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Montgomery ladder; Montgomery reduction; post-quantum cryptography; SIDH protocol","Acceleration; Cryptography; Ladders; Network protocols; Quantum cryptography; Elliptic curve; Kernel; Montgomery; Montgomery reduction; Post quantum cryptography; Proposals; Geometry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033722625"

In order to implement Toffoli or NCV circuits in such architectures, they need to be mapped to Clifford+T gates. Another challenge is that some CNOT gates cannot be directly implemented in the IBM quantum computers and must be changed to comply with the specific architecture constrains. In this paper we propose a methodology to map Toffoli and NCV circuits such that they are compliant with a given IBM architecture. The proposed approach to accomplish this, is to find a set of low cost mappings for NCV and Toffoli circuits targeting IBM’s architecture constraints. With this approach, the number of CNOT that need to be changed will be reduced, resulting in a smaller circuit regarding the number of gates. To evaluate the proposed approach, Toffoli circuits were mapped to Clifford+T and then realized on IBM’s QX4 architecture. The benchmarks were compared with Toffoli circuits mapped without the methodology proposed in this paper and implemented on IBM QX4 using two different approaches. The results show that the proposed approach resulted in circuits with upÂ to 67% fewer gates compared with Qiskit and with upÂ to 50% fewer gates compared to a Clifford+T mapping algorithm. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","IBM QX architectures; NCV circuits; Toffoli circuits","Conformal mapping; Qubits; Timing circuits; ClIFFORD; CNOT gate; Low costs; Mapping algorithms; Number of gates; T-gates; Computer circuits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068223523"

Threshold logic is a promising alternative to conventional Boolean logic due to its suitability for emerging technologies, like memristors, quantum-dot cellular automata, resonant tunneling device, and spintronic devices. Identification and synthesis of TLF are essential tasks in a design flow based on such a logic strategy. The proposed method relies on irredundant sum-of-products Boolean function description form and exploits both ordering of variables and system of inequalities to assign the variable weights and the function threshold value. This is the first heuristic algorithm able to identify all threshold functions with up to six variables, being also more effective than other heuristic methods for functions with a larger number of variables. For functions obtained from {k} -cuts of benchmark circuits, experimental results demonstrated effectiveness near to 100% when compared to exact methods, even when the number of function variables increases.

Nevertheless, from a therapeutics and prodrugs design point of view, a substituent group can modify the electronic structure, the physicochemical features and chemical reactivity which are critical for the biological activity. In this work, we analyze the substituent effects on the physicochemical properties, toxicity, chemical reactivity and its relation with the bacteriostatic activity of selected sulfonamides by means of DFT-M06-2X calculations in aqueous solution, using quantum chemical and docking descriptors. A correlation between the theoretical acidity and the pKa experimental values has been found. The more active sulfonamides have a larger acidity. The acidity increases with electron-withdrawing substituents. The main reactivity takes place on N4 atoms linked to aromatic ring, and in the SO2NH moiety, which are influenced by substituents. Docking descriptors showed binding affinities between sulfonamides and target receptor, the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Acidity; Bacteriostatic sulfonamides; DFT-M06-2X calculations; Dihydropteroate synthase; Toxicity","Algorithms; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Computer Simulation; Hydrogen Bonding; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Static Electricity; Structure-Activity Relationship; Sulfonamides; Amides; Binding energy; Bioactivity; Chemical analysis; Design for testability; Electronic structure; Quantum chemistry; Solid solutions; Solutions; Sulfur compounds; Toxicity; dihydropteroate synthase; glutamic acid; sulfonamide; antiinfective agent; sulfonamide; Anti-bacterial activity; Bacteriostatic; Computational studies; Dihydropteroate synthase; Electron-withdrawing substituents; Experimental values; Physicochemical features; Physicochemical property; acidity; aqueous solution; Article; bacteriostasis; chemical reaction; chemical structure; conformation; electrophilicity; nucleophilicity; physical chemistry; pKa; priority journal; proton transport; quantum chemistry; static electricity; toxicity; algorithm; chemistry; computer simulation; hydrogen bond; molecular model; structure activity relation; Acidity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043597393"

These reactions are very important in atmospheric chemistry. Additionally, these four-body reactions are also of basic relevance for chemical kinetics. Their kinetics has manifested non-Arrhenius behavior: the experimental rate constants for the OH + HCl and OH + H2 reactions, when extended to low temperatures, show a concave curvature in the Arrhenius plot, a phenomenon designated as sub-Arrhenius behavior, while reactions with HBr and HI are considered as typical processes that exhibit negative temperature dependence of the rate constants (anti-Arrhenius behavior). From a theoretical point of view, these reactions have been studied in order to obtain the potential energy surface and to reproduce these complex rate constants using the Transition State Theory. Here, in order to understand the non-Arrhenius mechanism, we exploit recent information from ab initio molecular dynamics. For OH + HI and OH + HBr, the visualizations of rearrangements of bonds along trajectories has shown how molecular reorientation occurs in order that the reactants encounter a mutual angle of approach favorable for them to proceed to reaction. Besides the demonstration of the crucial role of stereodynamics, additional documentation was also provided on the interesting manifestation of the roaming phenomenon, both regarding the search for reactive configurations sterically favorable to reaction and the subsequent departure of products involving their vibrational excitation. Under moderate tunneling regime, the OH + H2 reaction was satisfactory described by deformed-Transition-State Theory. In the same reaction, the catalytic effect of water can be assessed by path integral molecular dynamics. For the OH + HCl reaction, the theoretical rate coefficients calculated with Bell tunneling correction were in good agreement with experimental data in the entire temperature range 200–2000 K, with minimal effort compared to much more elaborate treatments. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulation showed that the orientation process was less effective than for HBr and HI reactions, emphasizing the role of the quantum tunneling effect of penetration of an energy barrier in the reaction path along the potential energy surface. These results can shed light on the clarification of the different non-Arrhenius mechanisms involved in four-body reaction, providing rate constants and their temperature dependence of relevance for pure and applied chemical kinetics. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","","Arrhenius plots; Atmospheric chemistry; Bromine compounds; Chlorine compounds; Computation theory; Curve fitting; Kinetics; Molecular dynamics; Molecular orientation; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Temperature distribution; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics; First principles molecular dynamics; Molecular reorientation; Non-Arrhenius kinetics; Path-integral molecular dynamics; Quantum tunneling effects; Transition state theories; Rate constants","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050002872"

A seven rings aromatic system (coronene) with a functional group in the edge was used as a simplified model of AC to evaluate the influence of SG in the course of adsorption from aqueous solution at basic pH conditions. Two SG were modeled in their deprotonated form: carboxyl and hydroxyl (–COO− and –O−), interacting with CLDh. In order to model the solvation process, all systems under study were calculated with up to three water molecules. Multiple Minima Hypersurface (MMH) methodology was employed to study the interactions of CLDh with SG on AC using PM7 semiempirical Hamiltonian, to explore the potential energy surfaces of the systems and evaluate their thermodynamic association energies. The re-optimization of representative structures obtained from MMH was done using M06-2X Density Functional Theory. The Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) was used to characterize the interaction types. As result, the association of CLDh with acidic SG at basic pH conditions preferentially occurs between the two alcohol groups of CLDh with COO− and O− groups and by dispersive interactions of chlorine atoms of CLDh with the graphitic surface. On the other hand, the presence of covalent interactions between the negatively charged oxygen of SG and one hydrogen atom of CLDh alcohol groups (O−⋯HO interactions) without water molecules, was confirmed by QTAIM study. It can be concluded that the interactions of CLDh with acidic SG of AC under basic pH conditions confirms the physical mechanisms of adsorption process. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Acidic surface group; Activated carbon; Chlordecone; DFT; MMH; QTAIM","Carbon; Chlordecone; Density Functional Theory; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Models, Theoretical; Molecular Conformation; Surface Properties; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Association reactions; Atoms; Hamiltonians; Hydrates; Hydration; Insecticides; Molecules; pH; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Solutions; Structural optimization; activated carbon; alcohol; chlordecone; chlorine; functional group; graphite; hydrogen; oxygen; water; carbon; chlordecone; Acidic surface; Association energies; Chlordecone; Covalent interactions; Dispersive interactions; QTAIM; Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules; Semiempirical Hamiltonians; acidity; adsorption; alkalinity; aqueous solution; Article; chemical interaction; density functional theory; energy; molecular dynamics; molecular model; priority journal; proton transport; quantum theory; surface property; theoretical study; chemistry; conformation; pH; theoretical model; Density functional theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043979994"

Fully coupled quantum treatments were employed to investigate unconventional properties in nanoconfined molecular systems. In this way, we facilitate a complete theoretical analysis of the underlying dynamics that enables us to compute the energy levels and the nuclear spin isomers of a single water molecule trapped in a C                             60                              fullerene cage.

Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a simple and efficient implementation of the Reservoir Computing framework. The use of this kind of networks in system identification is advantageous due to its intrinsic dynamic behavior and fast training procedure. However, ESNs have global parameters that should be tuned in order to improve their performance in a determined task. Besides, the random generation of the reservoir weights of these networks may not be ideal in terms of performance. Thus, this work presents a method that automatically defines an ESN for system identification problems by using a real coded QIEA (QIEA-R) in a two-phase optimization procedure. The QIEA-R firstly searches for the best global parameters of an ESN; then, on a second stage, optimizes some of its reservoir weights. In two benchmark problems for system identification, the proposed method overcame the performance of a randomly generated ESN with the same global parameters and has presented comparable and, in most cases, better accuracy results in comparison to some methods which were applied to the same datasets. © 2018 IEEE.","Echo State Networks; Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms; System Identification","Benchmarking; Genetic algorithms; Identification (control systems); Religious buildings; Bench-mark problems; Echo state networks; Efficient implementation; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Reservoir Computing; System identification problems; Traditional genetic algorithms; Two-phase optimizations; Quantum theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056265932"

The information to teleport is spin-coded in one electron confined in a single quantum dot (SQD). The remaining double quantum dot (DQD) system has just an electron with spin that includes spin–orbit interaction. Charge and spin of the electron get hybridized with the site occupancy having two intrinsic quantum degrees of freedom. The DQD is prepared in a hybrid spin–orbit entangled (HES) Bell-like state with tunneling and site energies as time-dependent control parameters that are optimized by means of genetic algorithms (GAs). The hybrid entangled resources that we obtained allow spin-charge quantum state teleportation with a fidelity of 0.9972 and are used as a resource channel to establish the QT protocol. The spin state of the electron in the SQD interacts with the DQD spin–orbit entangled channel via a modulated exchange interaction to emulate Alice’s joint measurement required for QT with GA parameter control. A charge detection measurement in one of the DQD systems is sufficient to have the spin state teleported up to a unitary transformation. A specific joint measurement and unitary transformation were selected to test the protocol, and we obtain fidelity of 0.99 for the QTP.

It is shown that the use of a three-partite GHZ state and measurements instead of their EPR counterparts allows the experimenter to detect 2/3 of the times whenever one of the qubits involved in the measurement is affected by bit-flip noise through the mere observation of unexpected outcomes in the teleportation and superdense coding protocols when compared to the ideal case. It is shown that the use of post-selection after the detection of noise leads to an enhancement in the efficiency of the protocols. The idea is extended to any protocol using entangled states and measurements. Furthermore, a generalization is provided in which GHZ states and measurements with an arbitrary amount of qubits are used instead of EPR pairs, and remarkably, it is concluded that the optimal number of qubits is only three. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Entanglement; Error detection; GHZ states","Error detection; Quantum computers; Bipartite entanglement; Bit-flips; Entangled state; Entanglement; EPR pairs; GHZ state; Optimal number; Superdense coding; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048790384"

Herein, we report an improvement in H2 binding energy (Eb) of C2B4H6 by substituting H atoms with different functional groups like X = F, Cl, Br, and XY = BO, CN and NC via quantum-chemical density functional theory based computations. In going from B6H6                             2− to C2B4H6, the Eb value is reduced from 14.6 kJ mol−1 to 2.7 kJ mol−1. C2B4X6 and C2B4(XY)6 systems, which can bind a total of eight H2 molecules, with one H2 molecule occupying at each B-B-C face, possess an Eb value per H2 in the range of 4.5 kJ mol−1 for X = F, 3.9 kJ mol−1 for X = Cl, 5.9 kJ mol−1 for X = Br, 6.8 kJ mol−1 for XY = BO, 5.8 kJ mol−1 for XY = CN and 5.2 kJ mol−1 for XY = NC. The improvement in Eb value is found to be the highest in case of C2B4(BO)6, which has the ability to bind 6.6 gravimetric wt% of H2. The situation can be made more favorable by applying an external electric field. Energy decomposition analysis reveals that although the dispersion interaction (ca. 55–65%) has significant role in binding H2 with such types of molecules, contribution from electrostatic and orbital interaction is also considerable. Further, we modeled an extended system by linking C2B4(BO)n through ‘C ≡ C’ units for H2 storage purpose. The energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals gradually lessens with the increase in molecular length. Therefore, it can be tuned gradually by controlling the chain length, which may further open up their potency in the field of electronics.

They have been of considerable scientific and a wide practical interest including such areas as material science, biomedical applications, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Macrocyclic pyrrole-containingcompounds, such as phthalocyanines and porphyrins, can bind to the NP surface by a variety ofmodes: as monodentate ligands oriented perpendicular to the NP surface, parallel tothe NP surface, or, alternatively, in a perpendicular orientation bridging two adjacent NPs. Also, non-covalent (coordination) interactions may be realized between the NP via its metal centers and appropriate meso-attached groups of porphyrins. Recently, we showed computationally that the prominent structural feature of the core-modified MP(X)4 porphyrins (X = P) is their significant distortion from planarity. Motivated bythe phenomenon of numerous complexes formation between tetrapyrrols and NPs, weperformed the density functional theory (DFT) studies of the complex formation between the core-modified ZnP(X)4 species (X = P and S) without any substituents orlinkers and semiconductor NPs, exemplified by small NP Zn6S6. The complexes formation was investigated using the following theoretical approaches: (i) B3LYP/6-31G* and (ii) CAM-B3LYP/6-31G*, both in the gas phase and with implicit effects from C6H6 considered. The calculated binding energies of the complexes studied were found to be significant, varying from ca. 29 up to ca. 69 kcal/mol, depending on the complex and the approach employed. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Complexes formation; Core-modified metalloporphyrins; Density functional theory; Semiconductor quantum dots","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089077696"

Recently, two constant-time versions of CSIDH have been proposed: first by Meyer, Campos and Reith, and then by Onuki, Aikawa, Yamazaki and Takagi. While both offer protection against timing attacks and simple power consumption analysis, they are vulnerable to more powerful attacks such as fault injections. In this work, we identify and repair two oversights in these algorithms that compromised their constant-time character. By exploiting Edwards arithmetic and optimal addition chains, we produce the fastest constant-time version of CSIDH to date. We then consider the stronger attack scenario of fault injection, which is relevant for the security of CSIDH static keys in embedded hardware. We propose and evaluate a dummy-free CSIDH algorithm. While these CSIDH variants are slower, their performance is still within a small constant factor of less-protected variants. Finally, we discuss derandomized CSIDH algorithms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Security of data; Software testing; Addition chains; Attack scenarios; Constant factors; Constant time; Embedded hardware; Fault injection; Power consumption analysis; Supersingular curves; Side channel attack","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072865372"

Analytical relations between three-tangles of three-qubit marginal states, two-tangles of two-qubit marginal states and unitary invariants of four-qubit pure state are used to obtain the inequality. The contribution of three-tangle to one-tangle is found to be half of that suggested by a simple extension of entanglement monogamy relation for three qubits. On the other hand, an additional contribution due to a two-qubit invariant which is a function of three-way correlations is found. We also show that four-qubit monogamy inequality conjecture of Regula et al.

The parametrization is carried out separately for the intra- and intermolecular contributions, employing respectively the Joyce and Picky software packages, previously implemented and refined in our research group. The whole approach is here automated and integrated with a computationally effective yet accurate method, devised very recently (J. Chem. Theory. Comput., 2018, 14, 543-556) to evaluate a large number of dimer interaction energies. The resulting quantum mechanically derived FFs are then used in extensive molecular dynamics simulations, in order to evaluate a number of thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic properties of the heterocycle's gas and liquid phases.

It was used the bulk heterojunction architecture under the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Field's Metal (FM) and the active film thickness range was 40-165 nm. FM is a eutectic alloy, composed by 32.5% Bi, 51% In and 16.5% Sn, that melt at 65°C and is easily deposited on top of the electron transport layer (ETL) at low temperature (∼ 90 °C). EQE set up was a home-made and the IQE spectra for the active film thickness range were determined from EQE and net internal absorption spectra; net absorption was estimated through the transfer matrix method (TMM). It was observed a significant reduction of IQE with the increasing of the active layer thickness up to 120 nm. IQE decreases and consequently EQE and PCE too because of the reduction in charge carriers collection. It was calculated the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from these measurements and compared these values with those achieved by the J-V plots to verify EQE results. It is noteworthy that EQE takes into account the effect of optical losses by reflection and transmission, while IQE is related with the efficiency of the photons that are not reflected or transmitted out of the cell. © 2018 SPIE.","active film thickness variation; EQE; IQE; OPVs; PTB7-Th; transfer matrix method","Efficiency; Electron transport properties; Film thickness; Heterojunctions; Perovskite; Temperature; Thin films; Transfer matrix method; Active films; Bulk heterojunction; Electron transport layers; Internal quantum efficiency; OPVs; Organic photovoltaic (OPV); Power conversion efficiencies; Reflection and transmission; Quantum efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055412657"

The ability to anticipate the efficacy of adding a staple to a peptide through computational simulations may contribute to lowering the costs associated with rational drug design. We evaluated the capabilities of different force fields to reproduce the effect of all-hydrocarbon staples in molecular dynamics simulations. Using the AMBER99SB-ILDN, CHARMM36, and GROMOS54A7 force fields and two distinct initial conformations, we compared our results to experimentally obtained circular dichroism data. The GROMOS54A7 united-atom force field seems to be more accurate compared with all-atom force fields, despite being unable to reproduce the effect of the staple in some of the simulated systems. With further force field enhancements, MD simulations may be used to anticipate conformational effects of all-hydrocarbon staples in peptides.

The comprehension and rationalization of the metal–ligand interaction is fundamental to pave the way for future applications as the design of new conducting materials. For that reason, this investigation sheds light on the electronic details behind the cation–π interactions present in ruthenophanes by using [Ru(η                             6                             -C                             16                             H                             16                             )(NH                             3                             )                             3                             ]                             2+                              as a model. Zeroth-order symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT0) shows the interaction Ru(II)–[2.2]paracyclophane with a predominant covalent character. However, the hapticity analysis of [2.2]paracyclophane shows only two predominantly covalent Ru–C bonds, as highlighted by the total energy density, H(r), in the bond critical point (BCP) obtained from quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) method, and by second-order stabilization energy, ΔE                             (2)                             , related to the processes: π C–C → d                             σ                              or d                             π                              Ru, achieved in the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. The other two Ru–C chemical bonds show a largely electrostatic character, as can be visualized from the delocalization index, DI, between the electron basins in the electron localization function (ELF) method. Remarkably, the interacting quantum atoms (IQA) method showed practically the same value of the total interaction energy, EintAB, between Ru and these C atoms and, then, corroborates the hapticity four of the ligand: [2.2]paracyclophane.

The screen is constructed by opposite sides of the virtual tetrahedron built by the six distances between four centers and provides coordinates for a two-dimensional square plot. As alternative e.g. to Ramachandran diagrams based on angles, it may offer greater accuracy and sensitivity. The screen was initially employed to peroxides and persulfides, to monitor the distances relevant to chirality changing processes and successively to show some electric and kinetic properties. The smallest chiral aminoacid, alanine, was therefore chosen for the basic illustration presented here. A virtual tetrahedron is built by the six distances between four centers of the aminoacid skeleton: they do not necessarily coincide with bonds, so a computer program permits their calculation from tabulations of experimental and theoretical data. Here, the screen is applied to treat significant geometrical features of alanine as affected by adjacent aminoacids in peptide chains, as available on protein databases. In this exemplary presentation applications of screen plots are limited to biochemistry: elsewhere have been shown useful in other areas, such as spin networks and the kinematics of a four-bar mechanism. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aminoacid; Database; Four-center processes; Protein; Quantum angular momentum theory","Amino acids; Computation theory; Database systems; Geometry; Mechanisms; Proteins; Angular momentum theory; Extraction of information; Four-bar mechanisms; Geometrical features; Kinetic properties; Polypeptide chain; Protein database; Specific sequences; Classification (of information)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068616074"

In order to enable the exploration of this technology, we propose a model for the logic synthesis of QCA circuits that, for the first time, considers and abstracts all main physical aspects - in particular, energy dissipation. To this end, we review in detail how energy is dissipated in QCA cells and present a corresponding environment that allows for the estimation of the energy dissipation with respect to any specific set of technology parameters. Based on that, we derive a model for logic synthesis. A case study confirms the accuracy of the proposed model and reveals that interconnections have a significant impact in this technology - motivating a more rigorous consideration. These findings eventually provide the basis for a new generation of synthesis approaches at the logic level that are explicitly dedicated to QCA systems. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Energy dissipation; field-coupled nanocomputing; logic synthesis; quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)","Codes (symbols); Computer circuits; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Logic Synthesis; Nanocrystals; Power management; Semiconductor quantum dots; Energy aware; Logic levels; Nano-computing; Physical aspects; Quantum dot cellular automata; Quantum dot cellular automaton (QCA); Technology parameters; Cellular automata","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040034800"

Inspired by a previous scheme for optical cavities (Prado et al. in Phys Rev A 73:043803, 2006), we employ a superconducting qubit coupled to two nondegenerate quantum modes and use a driving field on the qubit to adequately control the resonator–qubit interaction. Based on the generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum states, firstly we analyze the validity of our model in the ideal situation and then we investigate the influence of the dissipation mechanisms on the generation of the two-mode squeezing operation, namely the qubit and resonator mode decays and qubit dephasing. We show that our scheme allows the generation of highly squeezed states even with the state-of-the-art parameters, leading to a theoretical prediction of more than 10 dB of two-mode squeezing. Furthermore, our protocol is able to squeeze an arbitrary initial state of the resonators, which makes our scheme attractive for future applications in continuous-variable quantum information processing and quantum metrology in the realm of circuit quantum electrodynamics. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Circuit quantum electrodynamics; EPR states; Squeezed states; Two-mode squeezing operator","Electrodynamics; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Resonators; Superconducting resonators; Timing circuits; Continuous variables; Dissipation mechanism; Quantum electrodynamics; Quantum-information processing; Squeezed state; Superconducting qubits; Two-mode squeezed vacuum state; Two-mode squeezing; Light transmission","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049250418"

All single qubit gates are implemented, but only a subset of the possible CNOT are provided. It is well known that the functionally of the missing gates can be achieved by a sequence of gates. The sequence of gates is based on SWAP gates. Up to seven elementary gates are required to implement a SWAP gate. In this paper we show how the same effect can be achieved with fewer gates. To show the potential of the proposed transformations, an example is presented where a reduction of 44% in the gate count and a 26% reduction in the number of levels for IBM's QX5 computer is achieved. An algorithm that is considered state of the art, is used for the comparison. © 2018 IEEE.","","Qubits; Systems analysis; ClIFFORD; CNOT gate; Elementary gates; Gate count; Single-qubit gates; State of the art; SWAP gate; T-gates; Computer circuits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065963720"

Like the AES New Instructions (AES-NI) that target the AES encryption algorithm, the release of the SHA New Instructions (SHA-NI), designed to support the SHA-256 hash function, introduces a new scenario for optimizing cryptographic software. In this work, we present a performance evaluation of several cryptographic algorithms, hash-based signatures and data encryption, on platforms that support AES-NI and/or SHA-NI. In particular, we revisited several optimization techniques targeting multiple-message hashing, and as a result, we reduce by 21% the running time of this task by means of a pipelined SHA-NI implementation. In publickey cryptography, multiple-message hashing is one of the critical operations of the XMSS and XMSSMT post-quantum hash-based digital signatures. Using SHA-NI extensions, signatures are computed 4× faster; however, our pipelined SHA-NI implementation increased this speedup factor to 4.3×. For symmetric cryptography, we revisited the implementation of AES modes of operation and reduced by 12% and 7% the running time of CBC decryption and CTR encryption, respectively. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","AES-NI; Data Encryption; Hash-based Digital Signatures; SHA-NI; Vector Instructions","Chromium compounds; Computer architecture; Hash functions; Network security; Public key cryptography; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic software; Data encryption; Instruction set architecture; Modern architectures; Optimization techniques; Performance evaluations; Symmetric cryptography; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049410484"

Thus, cryptosystems resilient to quantum computing must be considered, especially for devices in the Internet of Things which limitations may hinder the use of secure cryptosystems. An alternative is the use of hash-based signatures which are post-quantum and provide a flexible trade-off between performance (both storage and processing time) and security level adaptable to a device’s restrictions. This paper presents a straightforward background on basic hash-based signatures, an implementation of hash-based signatures schemes, specifically Winternitz and Merkle Signature Scheme, on an Arduino Due platform, and a performance evaluation.

The realization of experiments that can perform both capabilities in the same setup can open an avenue of possibilities in the development of such practical quantum technologies. We theoretically investigate the feasibility of implementing a quantum memory and an optical transistor in the same setup using a combination of electromagnetically induced transparency and cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-EIT) for single- and two-sided cavity configurations. This was accomplished by considering a single three-level atom in Λ configuration coupled to a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity and a suitable temporal shape for the EIT control field. An optical transistor in cavity-EIT can be realized in a symmetric cavity with two output channels while a high efficient quantum memory must be performed in a single-sided one. From the master equation and input–output formalisms for the intracavity and outside fields, respectively, we obtain the upper bound of 50 % for the memory efficiency with perfect transistor action in two-sided cavities and values close to 100 % for the efficiency with a limited transistor effect for the single-sided setup in the high cooperativity regime. Thus, we showed that a dual device, which operates as a quantum memory and an optical transistor in the same setup of cavity-EIT, can be accomplished with some limitation in one of those capabilities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Electromagnetically; Induced transparency; Light-matter interaction; Optical cavities; Optical transistor; Quantum memory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054318673"

For the Ag+-mediated guanine tetramer, we found the maug-cc-pvdz basis set to be sufficient for calculating electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Our calculations further show that the B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, B3LYP*, and PBE exchange-correlation functionals are all able to predict negative peaks in the measured ECD spectra within a 20 nm range. However, a spurious positive peak is present in the CAM-B3LYP ECD spectra. We trace the origins of this spurious peak and find that is likely due to the sensitivity of silver atoms to the amount of Hartree–Fock exchange in the exchange-correlation functional.

Understanding the molecular determinants for the interaction of this enzyme with its substrates is essential in the rational design of engineered peroxidases for biotechnological application. Here, we combine computational and experimental approaches to analyze the interaction of Phanerochaete chrysosporium LiP (isoenzyme H8) with VA and its radical cation (VA•+, resulting from substrate oxidation by the enzyme). Interaction energy calculations at semiempirical quantum mechanical level (SQM) between LiP and VA/VA•+ enabled to identify those residues at the acidic environment of catalytic Trp171 involved in the main interactions. Then, a battery of variants, with single and multiple mutations at these residues (Glu168, Asp165, Glu250, Asp264, and Phe267), was generated by directed mutagenesis, and their kinetics parameters were estimated on VA and two additional substrates. The experimental results show that Glu168 and Glu250 are crucial for the binding of VA, with Glu250 also contributing to the turnover of the enzyme. The experimental results were further rationalized through new calculations of interaction energies between VA/VA•+ and LiP with each of the single mutations. Finally, the delocalization of spin density was determined with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations (QM/MM), further supporting the contribution of Glu250 to VA oxidation at Trp171. © 2019 The Authors","Interaction energy; Lignin peroxidase; Phanerochaete chrysosporium; QM/MM; Sited-directed mutagenesis; SQM; Veratryl alcohol","Biodegradation; Enzymes; Oxidation; Phanerochaete Chrysosporium; Substrates; Binding energy; Biodegradation; Lignin; Molecular modeling; Mutagenesis; Oxidation; Quantum theory; Substrates; lignin peroxidase; veratryl alcohol; Directed mutagenesis; Interaction energies; Lignin peroxidase; Molecular mechanics calculations; Phanerochaete chrysosporium; Quantum mechanic/molecular mechanic calculation; Quantum mechanical levels; Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; Semi-empirical; Semiempirical quantum mechanical level; Sited-directed mutagenesis; Veratryl alcohol; Article; catalyst; comparative study; comprehension; density functional theory; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme substrate complex; experimental study; hydrogen bond; nonhuman; oxidation; Phanerochaete; priority journal; quantum mechanics; site directed mutagenesis; stereospecificity; theoretical study; Enzymes","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070393110"

This procedure reduces the dimensionality of the dataset (avoiding the dimensionality curse) and improves the classification accuracy of the system. One of the most successful models applied for this task is the use of an Evolutionary Algorithm in a wrapper approach. These models produce excellent results but present the drawback of a considerable high processing time, a critical limitation for its application on real Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) systems. Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithms can be an alternative wrapper approach for the feature selection task, given that they outperform classical Evolutionary Algorithms in the exploration and exploitation of the search space, obtaining the global solution much faster. These algorithm employs concepts and principles from the Quantum Mechanics to probabilistically describe a set of different states between the classical logic states 0 and 1. In this paper, a Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm is developed and tested over three different subjects from publicly available datasets.

Solar cells are a promising alternative to such energy problem. However, high solar cells efficiencies have not been achieved yet. Graphene Carbon Quantum Dots (GCQDs) are a type of nano structures with great potential to improve solar cells efficiencies. GCQDs optical properties are not fully understood. To study the optical properties of GCQDs, a synthesis of GCQDs through a pyrolysis method using Citric Acid as a carbon source had been realized. Changing the pyrolisis exposition time, samples with different GCQD sizes were obtained. The absorption spectra of the samples was measured. In addition, calculations of the absorption spectra and Density of States (DoS) based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the software Quantum Espresso were performed. A good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results was obtained. The absorption spectra and the simulations shown two absorption bands. Based on the DoS calculations, the origin of the lower and higher energy absorption bands could be associated to transitions between carbon-oxygen (π-π                             ∗                             ) and carbon-carbon (π-π                             ∗                             ) states, respectively.                          © 2018 IEEE.","Absorption spectrum simulation; Carbon quantum dots; Density functional theory calculations; Quantum Espresso; Solar cells enhancers","Absorption spectra; Absorption spectroscopy; Graphene; Nanocrystals; Optical properties; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solar cells; A-carbon; Carbon carbons; Carbon quantum dots; Density of state; Energy problem; Quantum Espresso; Sustainable clean energy; Density functional theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061486715"

These are intermediates in the biosynthesis of the post-translationally modified histidine residue diphthamide (DTA), a unique and essential residue part of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Herein, the promiscuity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dph5 has been studied with in silico approaches, including homology modeling to provide the structure of Dph5, protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics to construct the Dph5-eEF2 complex, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to outline a plausible mechanism. The calculations show that the methylation of ACP follows a typical SN2 mechanism, initiating with a complete methylation (trimethylation) at the N-position, followed by the single O-methylation. For each of the three N-methylation reactions, our calculations support a stepwise mechanism, which first involve proton transfer through a bridging water to a conserved aspartate residue D165, followed by a methyl transfer. Once fully methylated, the trimethyl amino group forms a weak electrostatic interaction with D165, which allows the carboxylate group of diphthine to attain the right orientation for the final methylation step to be accomplished.

This allows to overcome physical boundaries of conventional solutions such as CMOS and, hence, constitutes a promising direction for future computing devices. Despite these promises, however, the development of (automatic) design methods for QCAs is still in its infancy. In fact, QCA circuits are mainly designed manually thus far and only few heuristics are available. This frequently leads to unsatisfactory results and generally makes it hard to evaluate the quality of respective QCA designs. In this work, we propose an exact solution for the design of QCA circuits that can be configured e.g.To generate circuits that satisfy certain design objectives and/or physical constraints. For the first time, this allows for design exploration of QCA circuits.

The solution in a classical computer requires N queries because it uses sorting to check whether there are equal elements. In the quantum case, it is possible to solve the problem in O(N2 / 3) queries. There is an extension which asks whether there are k colliding elements, known as element k-distinctness problem. This work obtains optimal values of two critical parameters of Ambainis’ seminal quantum algorithm (SIAM J Comput 37(1):210–239, 2007). The first critical parameter is the number of repetitions of the algorithm’s main block, which inverts the phase of the marked elements and calls a subroutine. The second parameter is the number of quantum walk steps interlaced by oracle queries.

Despite physical components being considered are normally two-level systems, still the combination of some of them together with their entangling interactions (another key property in the quantum information processing) become in a complex dynamics needing be addressed and modeled under precise control to set programmed quantum processing tasks. Universal quantum gates are simple controlled evolutions resembling some classical computation gates. Despite their simple forms, not always become easy fit the quantum evolution to them. SU(2) decomposition is a mechanism to reduce the dynamics on SU(2) operations in composed quantum processing systems. It lets an easier control of evolution into the structure required by those gates by the adequate election of the basis for the computation grammar. In this arena, SU(2) decomposition has been studied under piecewise magnetic field pulses. Despite, it is completely applicable for time-dependent pulses, which are more affordable technologically, could be continuous and then possibly free of resonant effects. In this work, we combine the SU(2) reduction with linear and quadratic numerical approaches in the solving of time-dependent Schrödinger equation to model and to solve the controlled dynamics for two-qubits, the basic block for composite quantum systems being analyzed under the SU(2) reduction. A comparative benchmark of both approaches is presented together with some useful outcomes for the dynamics in the context of quantum information processing operations. © Rinton Press.","Gate design; Heisenberg-ising anisotropic model; Non-local gates","Dynamics; Logic gates; Anisotropic models; Composite quantum systems; Gate design; Nonlocal; Numerical approaches; Of quantum-information; Quantum-information processing; Universal quantum gates; Quantum optics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058823705"

By resorting to a systematic survey of a two-qubit system, we detected an undesirable behavior of such a measure related to its representation-dependence. In the case of pure states, this dependence manifests as a non-satisfactory entanglement measure whenever a representation other than the Schmidt’s is used. In order to avoid this basis-dependence feature, we argue that a minimization procedure over the set of all possible representations of the quantum state is required. In the case of pure states, this minimization can be analytically performed and the optimal basis turns out to be that of Schmidt’s. In addition, the resulting measure inherits the main properties of Guo’s measure and, unlike the latter, it reduces to a legitimate entanglement measure in the case of pure states. Some examples involving general mixed states are also analyzed considering such an optimization. The results show that, in most cases of interest, the use of Guo’s measure can result in an overestimation of quantum correlations. However, since Guo’s measure has the advantage of being easily computable, it might be used as a qualitative estimator of the presence of quantum correlations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bipartite systems; Hilbert–Schmidt norm; Non-commutative discord; Quantum correlations; Quantum correlations measure; Quantum discord","Optical variables control; Quantum entanglement; Bipartite systems; Non-commutative; Quantum correlations; Quantum discords; Schmidt; Quantum theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026682650"

II, Buenos Aires, C1428EHA, Argentina","The explicit simulation of time dependent electronic processes requires computationally onerous routes involving the temporal integration of motion equations for the charge density. Efficiency optimization of these methods typically relies on increasing the integration time-step and on the reduction of the computational cost per step. The implicit representation of inner electrons by effective core potentials-or pseudopotentials-is a standard practice in localized-basis quantum-chemistry implementations to improve the efficiency of ground-state calculations, still preserving the quality of the output. This article presents an investigation on the impact that effective core potentials have on the overall efficiency of real time electron dynamics with TDDFT. Interestingly, the speedups achieved with the use of pseudopotentials in this kind of simulation are on average much more significant than in ground-state calculations, reaching in some cases a factor as large as 600×. This boost in performance originates from two contributions: on the one hand, the size of the density matrix, which is considerably reduced, and, on the other, the elimination of high-frequency electronic modes, responsible for limiting the maximum time-step, which vanish when the core electrons are not propagated explicitly. The latter circumstance allows for significant increases in time-step, that in certain cases may reach up to 3 orders of magnitude, without losing any relevant chemical or spectroscopic information. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016147730"

This approach combines the any-particle molecular orbital method, in which both electrons and H/D nuclei are described as quantum waves, with the auxiliary density perturbation theory, to calculate analytically the polarizability tensor. We assess the performance of method by calculating the polarizability isotope effect for 20 molecules. A good correlation between theoretical and experimental data is found. Further analysis of the results reveals that the change in the polarizability of a X-H bond upon deuteration decreases as the electronegativity of X increases. Our investigation also reveals that the molecular polarizability isotope effect presents an additive character. Therefore, it can be computed by counting the number of deuterated bonds in the molecule. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Density functional theory; Isotope effect; Non-covalent interactions; Nuclear orbital; Polarizability","hydrogen; isotope; Article; calculation; density functional theory; hydrogen bond; polarization; priority journal; quantum mechanics; theoretical model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013374695"

Phys. Commun. 190 (2015) 182–199 Does the new version supersede the previous version? For the use with Mathematica 11, yes. Reasons for the new version: The previous version (anQCD.m) does not work in Mathematica version 11. Summary of revisions: When calling the previous version (anQCD.m) with Mathematica 11, the message SystemException[“MemoryAllocationFailure”] appears, because version 11 of Mathematica apparently cannot deal efficiently with numerical dispersion integrals where the integration is over semiinfinite interval and is slowly converging. Therefore, in the new version, in the integrals J0[Nf] for the Two-delta analytic QCD model the upper integration bound is changed from ‘Infinity’ to $wmaxJ=108.5. This modification does not change the precision of evaluations in any significant manner. Nature of problem: Evaluation of spacelike physical QCD quantities D(Q2) (Q2≡−q2 nonnegative) in terms of a truncated perturbation series of the perturbative QCD coupling a(Q2)≡αs(Q2)∕π gives us a quantity which has singularities at low positive Q2, because a(Q2) has such singularities. This is incompatible with the holomorphic (analytic) properties of D(Q2) as required by the general principles of Quantum Field Theories. Further, for low |Q2| such evaluations give very unreliable results dominated by the vicinity of the mentioned (unphysical) singularities. However, if using instead a coupling A(Q2) which respects the mentioned analyticity properties in the complex Q2-plane, then such problems do not appear. Solution method: anQCDv2.m package evaluates the coupling A(Q2) and the analogs Aν(Q2) of the powers a(Q2)ν, for three versions of QCD with couplings with aforementioned analytic properties: Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT); Two-delta analytic QCD (2δanQCD); and Massive Perturbation Theory (MPT). The couplings are evaluated by numerical evaluation of the corresponding dispersion integrals. Reference: C. Ayala and G.

As an example, we construct a family [[46,2(t2-t1),d]]25 of quantum codes, where t1, t2 are positive integers such that 1 < t1< t2< 23 and d≥ min { 46 - 2 t2, 2 t1- 2} , of length n= 46 , with minimum distance in the range 2 ≤ d≤ 20 , having Singleton defect at most four. Additionally, by applying the CSS construction to sequences of t-point (classical) AG codes constructed in this paper, we generate sequences of asymptotically good quantum codes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algebraic geometry codes; Asymptotically good codes; Quantum codes","Algebra; Codes (symbols); Defects; Geometry; Quantum computers; Algebraic geometry; Algebraic geometry code; Code length; Good code; Minimum distance; Positive integers; Quantum codes; Singleton defects; C (programming language)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019250197"

The catalytic mechanism was examined by quantum-mechanical calculations using an active-site model based on the X-ray crystal structure of the human placental AP. Free energies of activation and of reaction for the catalytic steps were evaluated for a series of aryl and alkyl phosphate esters, and the computational results were compared with experimental values available in the literature. Mechanistic observations previously reported in experimental works were rationalized by the present theoretical study, particularly regarding the difference in the rate-determining step between aryl and alkyl phosphates. The formation rate of the covalent phosphoserine intermediate followed a linear free energy relationship (LFER) with the pKa of the leaving group. This LFER, which could be experimentally determined only for less reactive alkyl phosphates, was verified by the present calculations to apply for the entire set of aryl and alkyl phosphate substrates. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","","Alkaline Phosphatase; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Hydrolysis; Models, Molecular; Quantum Theory; Thermodynamics; Activation energy; Crystal structure; Esters; Free energy; Phosphatases; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; alkaline phosphatase; Active-site modeling; ALkaline phosphatase; Catalyse; Catalytic mechanisms; Linear free energy relationships; Model-based OPC; Phosphate monoesters; Quantum-mechanical calculation; Quantum-mechanical study; Transphosphorylation; biocatalysis; chemistry; enzyme active site; hydrolysis; metabolism; molecular model; quantum theory; thermodynamics; Catalysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027468782"

Its chemical composition and its abundance have focused efforts to unlock its potential as a source of aromatic compounds for many years. The lack of a proper way for lignin de-polymerization has hampered its success as a natural solution for commodity aromatic chemicals, which is also due to the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of lignin polymerization. A fuller fundamental understanding of polymerization mechanisms could lead to improvements in de-polymerization strategies, and therefore a proper methodology and a predictive theoretical framework are required for such purpose. This work presents a complete computational study on some of the key steps of lignin polymerization mechanisms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to evaluate the most appropriate methodology and to compute the chemical structures and reaction enthalpies for the monolignol dimerization, the simplest key step that controls the polymerization. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) has been applied to understand the coupling reaction mechanisms, for which the radical species and transition states (TSs) involved have been characterized. The coupling that leads to the formation of the β–O–4 linkage has been theoretically reproduced according to proposed mechanisms, for which weak interactions have been found to play a key role in the arrangement of reactants. The hydrogen bond formed between the oxygen of the phenoxy radical, and the alcohol of the aliphatic chain, together with the interaction between aromatic rings, locates the reactants in a position that favors such β–O–4 linkage.

Therefore, devising quantum-resistant replacements that combine efficiency with solid security guarantees is an important and challenging task. This paper proposes several contributions towards this goal. First, we introduce “CAKE”, a key encapsulation algorithm based on the QC-MDPC McEliece encryption scheme, with two major improvements: (a) the use of ephemeral keys that defeats a recent reaction attack against MDPC decoding of the corresponding encryption scheme and (b) a highly efficient key generation procedure for QC-MDPC-based cryptosystems. Then, we present an authenticated key exchange protocol based on CAKE, which is suitable for the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) standard. We prove that CAKE is IND-CPA secure, that the protocol is SK-Secure, and suggest practical parameters. Compared to other post-quantum schemes, we believe that CAKE is a promising candidate for post-quantum key exchange standardization. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Code-based cryptography; Key exchange; Post-quantum cryptography","Codes (symbols); Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Authenticated key exchange protocols; Code-based cryptography; Encryption schemes; Internet key exchange; Key exchange; Key generation; McEliece encryption scheme; Post quantum cryptography; Cryptography","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038209127"

Levin (Probl Inf Transm 39(1):92–103, 2003) has conjectured that the unitary transformation g(a, x) = (a, f(x) + ax) , where f is any length-preserving function and a,x∈GF2‖x‖, is an information-theoretically secure operator within a polynomial factor. Here, we show that Levin’s one-way permutation is provably secure because its output values are four maximally entangled two-qubit states, and whose probability of factoring them approaches zero faster than the multiplicative inverse of any positive polynomial poly(x) over the Boolean ring of all subsets of x.

Today, however, we are able to maintain the security and privacy of information, which is essential to current research in encryption. Encrypted information also forms a key part of scientific projects that involve human behavior, bank transactions, and economic, political and social phenomena. In this paper, we provide a theoretical overview of various encryption techniques, namely those that range from changes in the position of a letter or word, to word transformations and transposition. It may also include computer algorithms that have binary functions, which produce coding of a message. Thirdly, it encapsulates the latest advances in science, which are used to obtain the maximum objective of an encrypted message, i.e. the secret-coded message. For the latter, algorithms are used to determine quantum calculations. For this study, the concepts and processes that are discussed are based on algorithms. These not only provide security when sending messages, but also security for passwords that are used to decipher and to encrypt. The conclusions in this study examine the current theoretical framework, and propose the usage of methods to prevent online security breaches. These methods are presented in the proposal. Here we also argue that it is possible to achieve a mixture of cryptography algorithms that foster an improved performance and enhance the speed of safe transactions. © 2016 Information Systems Research Group, University of Fribourg.","ciphered; cryptography; encryption; password; secure","Algorithms; Authentication; Behavioral research; ciphered; Cryptography algorithms; Encrypted informations; Encryption technique; password; secure; Security and privacy; Theoretical framework; Cryptography","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971254710"

Effectively, the HOMO-LUMO gap is of 2.03 and 2.39 eV, respectively and the magnetic moments are of 1.0 magneton bohrs, coming from the boron atoms in both systems. The rich in boron nanosheets present high-polarity, either in the gas phase or embedded in aqueous mediums like water, as well as low chemical reactivity, signifying potential applicability in the transportation of pharmaceutical species in biological mediums.

We have employed four different methods, based on five different crystal structures: first, we docked the ligands to the proteins with induced-fit docking with the Glide software and calculated binding affinities with three energy functions. Second, the docked structures were minimised in a continuum solvent and binding affinities were calculated with the MM/GBSA method (molecular mechanics combined with generalised Born and solvent-accessible surface area solvation). Third, the docked structures were re-optimised by combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Then, interaction energies were calculated with quantum mechanical calculations employing 970–1160 atoms in a continuum solvent, combined with energy corrections for dispersion, zero-point energy and entropy, ligand distortion, ligand solvation, and an increase of the basis set to quadruple-zeta quality. Fourth, relative binding affinities were estimated by free-energy simulations, using the multi-state Bennett acceptance-ratio approach. Unfortunately, the results were varying and rather poor, with only one calculation giving a correlation to the experimental affinities larger than 0.7, and with no consistent difference in the quality of the predictions from the various methods. For one set of ligands, the results could be strongly improved (after experimental data were revealed) if it was recognised that one of the ligands displaced one or two water molecules. For the other two sets, the problem is probably that the ligands bind in different modes than in the crystal structures employed or that the conformation of the ligand-binding site or the whole protein changes. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bennett acceptance ratio; Big-QM; Blind-test competition; Continuum solvation; D3R grand challenge; Free-energy perturbation; Induced-fit docking; Ligand-binding affinity; MM/GBSA; QM/MM","Binding Sites; Entropy; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Kinetics; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Solvents; Thermodynamics; Water; Acceptance tests; Binding energy; Free energy; Molecular mechanics; Molecules; Proteins; Quantum theory; Solvation; Solvents; heat shock protein 90; heat shock protein 90 inhibitor; ligand; solvent; water; heat shock protein 90; ligand; protein binding; Bennett acceptance ratio; Big-QM; Blind test; Blind-test competition; Continuum solvations; D3R grand challenge; Free energy perturbation; Grand Challenge; Induced fit; Induced-fit docking; Ligand binding affinity; MM-GBSA; Quantum mechanic and molecular mechanic; Article; binding affinity; calculation; comparative study; computer simulation; controlled study; crystal structure; dispersion; energy; entropy; free energy simulation; generalised born and solvent accessible surface area solvation; ligand binding; molecular docking; molecular mechanics; priority journal; protein analysis; protein interaction; quantum mechanics; relative binding affinity; software; solvation; structure analysis; surface area; binding site; chemistry; human; kinetics; protein conformation; thermodynamics; Ligands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983775745"

Previous works used a quantum extractor operator (QEO) to iterate the qRAM. With the QEO the qRAM output channel can be fed back or iterated despite possible entanglement of the overall output quantum state. Two measures are used here for the quantitative analysis: Von Neummann entropy and entanglement entropy. We find that entanglement is disturbed and even increased when the QEO is used. In contrast entanglement stays unchanged under coherent feedback. The results indicate that QEO produces a more diverse dynamics and can be viewed as an environment interaction operator but not with decaying properties.

This structure may be a viable substitute for the industry's standard solar cell, which has to be reconsidered when faced with the bowing problem. We observed that increasing oxidation temperature decreases IQE for short wavelengths (400 nm), while for long wavelengths (1000 nm) the IQE increases for temperatures lower than 860 °C. The same trend is observed for the solar cells' open circuit voltages, indicating that rear surface passivation increases for thicker oxides. The short-circuit current density was affected by the higher reflectance caused by the SiO2 layer. However, by adjusting the TiO2 anti-reflective coating thickness we were able to avoid this effect, achieving solar cells with efficiencies up to 16.8 %, which is comparable to the current efficiency of cells with AI-BSF covering the whole back surface.

The optimized geometries indicate that the relative position of NO and H2O depends on the total charge: (ON.--H-OH), (NO−--H-OH), and (ON+--OH2). Moreover, atomic spin density along with frontier molecular orbitals help to identify the preferred reduction or oxidation sites on the nitric oxide. Thus, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), electron localization function (ELF), and natural bond-bond polarizability (NBBP) methods aid to quantify the electron delocalization level between NO and H2O, 1+ > 1. > 1−, and show the predominantly ionic, and covalent character to inter-molecular, and intra-molecular chemical bonds, respectively. Furthermore, the natural bond orbital (NBO) and localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (LMO-EDA) methods enable energy analyses of the interaction between NO and H2O in the complexes 1., 1+, and 1−. Where, the first method showed that the interaction between the natural bond orbitals in 1− is more favorable, than in 1+, and less in 1., however, the second method designates that the total interaction energy is lower for 1+ in relation to 1− and 1., due mainly to the electrostatic component. As a final point, analysis of the electrostatic potential surfaces provides a clear and direct explanation for the relative position of the monomers. It also shows that the predominant Coulombic attraction between H2O and the charged NO+, and NO− compounds will be stronger in relation to the neutral NO..

The ε-steering problem is introduced and solved for systems with drift: given any initial condition X0 at the initial time instant t0 ≥ 0, any goal state Xgoal ϵ U(n) and ε > 0, find a control law such that (Formula presented.) , where (Formula presented.) is big enough and dist(X1, X2) is a convenient right-invariant notion of distance between two elements X1, X2 ∈ U(n). The purpose is to approximately generate arbitrary quantum gates corresponding to Xgoal. This is achieved by solving a tracking problem for a special kind of reference trajectories (Formula presented.) : [t0, ∞) → U(n), which are here called c-universal reference trajectories. It is shown that, for this special kind of trajectories, the tracking problem can be solved up to an error ε for any reference trajectory (Formula presented.) which is a right-translation of (Formula presented.) , at least when (Formula presented.) is finite. Furthermore, it is shown that (Formula presented.) converges uniformly exponentially to zero in the sense that the rate of convergence is independent of t0, R and X0. The approach considered here for showing such convergence is a generalisation of the results of a previous paper of the authors, which is mainly based on the central ideas of Jurdjevic and Quinn and Coron's return method. Taking a right-translation R such that (Formula presented.) , one may solve the ε-steering problem by solving the tracking problem for the reference trajectory (Formula presented.) , at least when (Formula presented.). When (Formula presented.) , it is shown that the ε-steering problem can be globally solved in a two-iteration procedure. The underlying algorithmic complexity to get the steering control is essentially equivalent to the numerical integration of the Cauchy problem governing X(t). A numerical example considering a Toffoli quantum gate on U(8) for a chain of three coupled qubits that are controlled only locally is presented. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Controllable right-invariant systems; Coron's return method; LaSalle's invariance theorem; quantum control; unitary group","Computational complexity; Control theory; Invariance; Iterative methods; Lie groups; Logic gates; Navigation; Parallel processing systems; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Reconfigurable hardware; Trajectories; Uranium; Coron's return method; Invariant systems; Lasalle's invariance theorems; Quantum control; Unitary group; Problem solving","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964059446"

Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms based on binary and real representations have been previously developed to solve combinatorial and numerical optimization problems, providing better results than classical genetic algorithms with less computational effort. However, for ordering problems, order-based genetic algorithms are more suitable than those with binary and real representations. This is because specialized crossover and mutation processes are employed to always generate feasible solutions. Therefore, this work proposes a new quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm especially devised for ordering problems (QIEA-O). Two versions of the algorithm have been proposed. The so-called pure version generates solutions by using the proposed procedure alone. The hybrid approach, on the other hand, combines the pure version with a traditional order-based genetic algorithm. The proposed quantum-inspired order-based evolutionary algorithms have been evaluated for two well-known benchmark applications – the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP) – as well as in a real problem of line scheduling. Numerical results were obtained for ten cases (7 VRP and 3 TSP) with sizes ranging from 33 to 101 stops and 1 to 10 vehicles, where the proposed quantum-inspired order-based genetic algorithm has outperformed a traditional order-based genetic algorithm in most experiments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ordering optimization problem; Quantum bit; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Vehicle routing problem","Benchmarking; Genetic algorithms; Traveling salesman problem; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Benchmark applications; Crossover and mutation; Numerical optimizations; Order optimizations; Quantum bits; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988614418"

While there have been several proposals to optimize the process of achieving LNN compliance in 1D circuits, there are few proposals for 2D circuits. Here, we present a new perspective on this problem for 2D quantum circuits. We propose to see this as a multiobjective optimization problem with two objectives: minimizing the size of the 2D grid in the circuit, and minimizing the number of SWAP gates required to achieve LNN compliance. We present some preliminary results which show that these are two contradictory objectives. Since this is common in multiobjective problems, these results indicate that a multiobjective algorithm might be a suitable way to address this problem, since it would make considerations which currently available methods do not make. © 2016 IEEE.","linear nearest neighbor; LNN; multiobjective; quantum circuit","Optimization; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Linear nearest neighbors; Minimizing the number of; Multi objective; Multi objective algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objective problem; Multiobjective approach; Quantum circuit; Multiobjective optimization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013897757"

In particular, we focused on the rotations of the two hydroxyl-phenyl dihedral angles. A picture with a four stable rotamers emerged where only the most stable conformer has a planar structure and the less stable conformer has the maximum deviation from planarity. The computed PES shows that the energy barriers for the conformer interconversion are less than 15 kcal/mol. From the analysis of the calculated intramolecular hydrogen bond enthalpy, we conclude that the number of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds governs the conformer stability. Additionally, the conformational equilibrium was pursued by means of an analysis of the energy of OH internal rotation barriers. The total energy changes were decomposed in an electrostatic decomposition scheme in order to gain an insight into the effects governing the torsional barrier and preferred conformations. This analysis shows that the interplay between the repulsive and attractive potentials causes the conformer stability, where the attractive term dominates the conformer stabilisation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chrysophanol anthrone; DFT; hydrogen bond; potential energy surface; rotamers","Density functional theory; Dihedral angle; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Anthrone; Conformational equilibrium; Decomposition scheme; Internal rotation barrier; Intra-molecular hydrogen bonds; Physicochemical property; Rotamers; Torsional barriers; Hydrogen bonds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988484593"

ABINIT also allows to optimize the geometry according to the DFT forces and stresses, to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these forces, and to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges and dielectric tensors. The present paper aims to describe the new capabilities of ABINIT that have been developed since 2009. It covers both physical and technical developments inside the ABINIT code, as well as developments provided within the ABINIT package. The developments are described with relevant references, input variables, tests and tutorials.

Reasons for new version: Since 2009, the abinit-5.7.4 version of the code has considerably evolved and is not yet up to date. The abinit- 7.10.5 version contains new physical and technical features that allow electronic structure calculations impossible to carry out in the previous versions. Summary of revisions: • new physical features: quantum effects for the nuclei treated by the Path-integral Molecular Dynamics; finding transition states using image dynamics (NEB or string methods); two component DFT for electron-positron annihilation; linear response in a Projector Augmented-Wave approach -PAW-, electron-phonon interactions and temperature dependence of the gap; Bethe Salpeter Equation -BSE-; Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).• new technical features: development of a PAW approach for a wavelet basis; parallelisation of the code on more than 10,000 processors; new build system.• new features in the ABINIT package: tests; test farm; new tutorials; new pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data tables; GUI and postprocessing tools like the AbiPy and APPA libraries. Running time: It is difficult to answer to the question as the use of ABINIT is very large. On one hand, ABINIT can run on 10,000 processors for hours to perform quantum molecular dynamics on large systems. On the other hand, tutorials for students can be performed on a laptop within a few minutes.

The stability of covalent C8-dG DNA adducts was found to be mainly determined by π-stacking interactions between the fused ring system of the heteroaromatic amines and the flanking nucleobases.

Most methods that address the process of converting a generic circuit to an equivalent circuit which satisfies this restriction, minimize the number of additional SWAP gates required by this process. Moreover, most methods which address this problem are designed for 1D circuits. Considering the new and promising proposals for 2D quantum circuits, what we propose is a new perspective on this problem, namely that it can be seen as a multiobjective optimization problem. To test our hypothesis, we developed a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that solves this problem by considering two objectives: minimizing the size of the 2D grid where the circuit is placed, and minimizing the number of additional SWAP gates. Of the methods designed for 2D circuits, only one considers different grid sizes which are much larger than strictly necessary. Consequently, our algorithm makes considerations which other methods do not make, since it naturally finds the grid which requires fewer SWAP gates for the circuit conversion, whether it is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. Our experimental results indicate that allowing a larger grid size results in fewer additional SWAP gates in about 73% of the tested circuits. Additionally, the average improvement we found when using larger grid sizes is about 30%, while the best improvement over using the smallest possible grid is 63.8%. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Evolutionary algorithm; Linear nearest neighbor; LNN; Multiobjective optimization; Quantum circuit","Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Generic circuits; Grid size; Linear nearest neighbors; Minimizing the number of; Multi objective; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization problem; Quantum circuit; Equivalent circuits","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026661305"

Quantum computing is an attractive subject considering that quantum algorithms proved to be more efficient than classical algorithms and the advent of large-scale quantum computation. In particular, Grover's search algorithm is a quantum algorithm that is asymptotically faster than any classical search algorithm and it is relevant for the design of fast optimization algorithms. This article proposes two algorithms based on Grover's adaptative search for biobjective optimization problems where access to the objective functions is given via two different quantum oracles. The proposed algorithms, considering both types of oracles, are compared against NSGA-II, a highly cited multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm. Experimental evidence suggests that the quantum optimization methods proposed in this work are at least as effective as NSGA-II in average, considering an equal number of executions. Experimental results showed which oracle required less iterations for similar effectiveness. © 2017 PTI.","","Computational efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Bi-objective optimization; Experimental evidence; Grover's search algorithm; Multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization problem; Objective functions; Quantum algorithms; Quantum optimization; Optimization","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039911770"

There is a tension between specialization and generalization, with the current state trending to master slave models where accelerators (slaves) are instructed by a general purpose system (master) running an Operating System (OS). Traditionally, an OS is a layer between hardware and applications and its primary function is to manage hardware resources and provide a common abstraction to applications. Does this function, however, apply to new types of computing paradigms? This paper revisits OS functionality for memristor-based accelerators. We explore one accelerator implementation, the Dot Product Engine (DPE), for a select pattern of applications in machine learning, imaging, and scientific computing and a small set of use cases. We explore typical OS functionality, such as reconfiguration, partitioning, security, virtualization, and programming. We also explore new types of functionality, such as precision and trustworthiness of reconfiguration. We claim that making an accelerator, such as the DPE, more general will result in broader adoption and better utilization. ©2017 IEEE.","","Hardware; Learning systems; Memristors; Network security; Program processors; Stochastic systems; Computing paradigm; Feature sizes; General-purpose systems; Hardware resources; Master slave; Neuromorphic; Primary functions; Ultra low energy; Acceleration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043509311"

Advances in single photon emission have been achieved experimentally by introducing nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers on diamond nanostructures. However, theoretical modeling of the anisotropic effects on the electronic properties of these materials is almost nonexistent. In this study, the electronic band structure and density of states of diamond nanowires with N-V defects were analyzed through first principles approach using the density functional theory and the supercell scheme. The nanowires were modeled on two growth directions [001] and [111]. All surface dangling bonds were passivated with hydrogen (H) atoms. The results show that the N-V introduces multiple trap states within the energy band gap of the diamond nanowire. The energy difference between these states is influenced by the growth direction of the nanowires, which could contribute to the emission of photons with different wavelengths. The presence of these trap states could reduce the recombination rate between the conduction and the valence band, thus favoring the single photon emission. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","DFT; Diamond nanowires; Nitrogen-vacancy; Single photon emission","carbon; hydrogen; nanodiamond; nanowire; nitrogen; anisotropy; Article; band gap energy; controlled study; density functional theory; dispersion; electron; energy; hydrogen bond; photon; polarization; priority journal; surface property; theoretical study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029955150"

It considers both signal-dependent quantum and signal-independent electronic noise. Furthermore, the method accounts for pixel crosstalk, which causes the noise to be frequency-dependent, thus increasing the simulation accuracy. For an objective assessment, simulated and real images were compared in terms of noise standard deviation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS). A two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) study investigated the similarity between the noise strength of low-dose simulated and real images. Six experienced medical physics specialists participated on the study, with a total of 2 160 readings. Objective assessment showed no relevant trends with the simulated noise. The relative error in the standard deviation of the simulated noise was less than 2% for every projection angle. The relative error of the SNR was less than 1.5%, and the NNPS of the simulated images had errors less than 2.5%. The 2-AFC human observer experiment yielded no statistically significant difference (p =0.84) in the perceived noise strength between simulated and real images. Furthermore, the observer study also allowed the estimation of a dose difference at which the observer perceived a just-noticeable difference (JND) in noise levels. The estimated JND value indicated that a change of 17% in the current-time product was sufficient to cause a noticeable difference in noise levels. The observed high accuracy, along with the flexible calibration, make this method an attractive tool for clinical image-based simulations of dose reduction. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","digital breast tomosynthesis; dose reduction; Electronic noise; quantum noise","Algorithms; Breast; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Mammography; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiation Dosage; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Biomedical signal processing; Calibration; Errors; Estimation; Image reconstruction; Mammography; Medical imaging; Quantum noise; Standards; Statistics; Tomography; Biomedical imaging; Breast; Digital breast tomosynthesis; Dose reduction; Electronic noise; calibration; digital breast tomosynthesis; error; human; human experiment; image reconstruction; imaging; noise standard; physics; power spectrum; radiation dose; signal noise ratio; simulation; algorithm; breast; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; female; image enhancement; imaging phantom; mammography; procedures; radiation dose; signal noise ratio; Signal to noise ratio","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023177059"

It is shown that it is possible to implement universal symmetric telecloning in a probabilistic way using unambiguous state discrimination and quantum state separation schemes. It is also shown that other strategies, such as minimum error discrimination, lead to a decrease in the fidelity of the copies and that certain partially entangled pure states with maximal Schmidt rank lead to an average telecloning fidelity which is always above the optimal fidelity of measuring and preparation of quantum states.

This enzyme plays an important role in the microbial degradation of oil, chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuel additives, and many other compounds. A number of these enzymes has been biochemically characterized in detail because the potential of alkane hydroxylases to catalyse high added-value reactions is widely recognized. Nevertheless, the industrial and process bioremediation application of them is restricted, owing to their complex biochemistry, challenging process requirements, and the limited number of their three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, AlkB has great potential as biocatalysts for selective transformation of a wide range of chemically inert unreactive alkanes into reactive chemical precursors that can be used as tools for bioremediation and bioprocesses. Aiming to understand the possible ways the AlkB enzyme Pseudomonas putida P1 interacts with octane, octanol and 1-octyne, we consider its suitable biochemical structure taking into account a 3-D homology modelling. Besides, by using a quantum chemistry computational model based on the density functional theory (DFT), we determine possible protein-substrate interaction regions measured by means of its binding energy simulated throughout the Molecular Fractionation with Conjugated Caps (MFCC) approach. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","3-D homology modelling; Alkane hydroxylase; Binding energy; Pseudomonas putida P1; Quantum chemistry approach","Alkanes; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cytochrome P-450 CYP4A; Models, Molecular; Octanes; Pseudomonas putida; Quantum Theory; Bacteria; Binding energy; Biochemistry; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Complexation; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Degradation; Density functional theory; Enzymes; Fuel additives; Paraffins; Quantum chemistry; 1 octyne; alkane; alkane hydroxylase; bacterial enzyme; octane; octanol; oxygenase; unclassified drug; cytochrome P450 4A; Alkane hydroxylase; Chlorinated hydrocarbon; Homology modelling; Molecular fractionation with conjugated caps; Protein-substrate interactions; Pseudomonas putida; Selective transformation; Three-dimensional structure; amino acid sequence; Article; bacterial strain; binding affinity; bioremediation; computer model; controlled study; density functional theory; ligand binding; molecular docking; molecular model; nonhuman; priority journal; protein interaction; protein secondary structure; Pseudomonas putida; quantum chemistry; chemistry; enzymology; molecular model; Pseudomonas putida; quantum theory; Biodegradation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028948853"

Quantum database search of Grover achieves the task of finding the target element in an unsorted database in a time quadratically faster than the classical computer.

Especially in terms of public key cryptosystems, which are widely used on the Internet. However, public key cryptography was threatened and new sources began to be investigated when Shor in 1997 developed a polynomial time algorithm for factoring integers and to compute the discrete logarithm with a quantum computer. In this context, Patarin proposed Hidden Field Equations (HFE), a trapdoor based on MQ (Multivariate Quadratic) and IP (Isomorphism of Polynomials) problems. Such problems are not affected by the Shor algorithm, moreover MQ Problem was proved by Patarin and Goubin to be NP-complete. Despite the basic HFE has been broken, there are variants that are secure, obtained by a generic modification. The Quartz digital signature scheme based on HFEv-, with special choice of parameters is a good example of this resistance to algebraic attacks aimed at the recovery of the private key, because even today it remains secure. Furthermore, it also generates short signatures. However, Joux and Martinet, based on axioms of Birthday Paradox Attack, proved that Quartz is malleable, showing that if the adversary has a valid pair (message, signature), he can get a second signature with 250 computations and 250 calls to the signing oracle, so that the estimated current security standards are at least 2112. Thus, based on Quartz, we present a new digital signature scheme, achieving the adaptive chosen message attacks that make calls to the random oracle, with a security level estimated at 2112. Our cryptosystem also provides an efficiency gain in signature verification algorithm and vector initializations that will be used for signing and verification algorithms. Furthermore we provide an implementation of Original Quartz and Enhanced Quartz in the Java programming language. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital Signature; MPKC; MQ Problem; Post-Quantum Cryptography; Quartz","Algorithms; Computer programming; Cryptography; Electronic document identification systems; Java programming language; Network security; Polynomial approximation; Problem oriented languages; Public key cryptography; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quartz; Digital signature schemes; Isomorphism of polynomials; MPKC; MQ Problem; Polynomial-time algorithms; Post quantum cryptography; Public key cryptosystems; Verification algorithms; Authentication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84984924313"

When taking advantage of entanglement correlations, the state space can be made even larger. Here, we exploit the entanglement between two dimensional space and polarization qubits, to realize a four-dimensional quantum key distribution protocol. This is achieved by using entangled states as a basis, analogous to the Bell basis, rather than typically encoding information on individual qubits. The encoding and decoding in the required complementary bases is achieved by manipulating the Pancharatnam-Berry phase with a single optical element: a q-plate. Our scheme shows a transmission fidelity of 0.98 and secret key rate of 0.9 bits per photon. While the use of only static elements is preferable, we show that the low secret key rate is a consequence of the filter based detection of the modes, rather than our choice of encoding modes. © 2017 SPIE.","entanglement; Quantum key distribution; vector modes","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Encoding (symbols); Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Signal encoding; Encoding informations; entanglement; Entanglement correlation; High-dimensional encoding; Pancharatnam-Berry phase; Quantum key distribution protocols; Two dimensional spaces; Vector mode; Quantum cryptography","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029010932"

Simulation of these systems is very relevant to develop and test new quantum algorithms. In order to overcome the increase in simulation complexity, this work presents reduction and decomposition optimizations for the Distributed Geometric Machine environment. By exploring properties as the sparsity of the Identity operator and partiality of dense unitary transformations, better storage and distribution of quantum information are achieved. The main improvements are reached by decreasing replication and void elements inherited from quantum operators. In the evaluation of this proposal, Hadamard transformations from 21 to 28 qubits and Quantum Fourier Transforms from 26 to 28 qubits were simulated over CPU, sequentially and in parallel, and in graphics processing unit, showing reduced temporal complexity and, consequently, shorter simulation time. Moreover, evaluations of the Shor's algorithm considering 2n + 3 qubits in the order-finding quantum algorithm were simulated up to 25 qubits. When comparing our implementations running on the same hardware with language-integrated quantum operation, academic release version, our new simulator was faster and allowed for the simulation of more qubits.

In this paper, we present a thorough description of this function and analyze the number of elementary operations (ops) needed, under some possible alternative implementations, to compute it on a classical computer. As we note, it is worthwhile doing some analytical developments in order to avoid making null multiplications and sums, what can considerably reduce the ops. For instance, for a bipartite system Hα ⊗ Hb with dimensions dα = dimH α and db = dimH b and for dα; db > 1, while a direct use of PTr definition applied to H b requires O(d6 αd6b ) ops, its optimized implementation entails O(d2 αdb ) ops. In the sequence, we regard the computation of PTrs for general multipartite systems and describe Fortran code provided to implement it numerically. We also consider the calculation of reduced density matrices via Bloch's parametrization with generalized Gell Mann's matrices. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Bloch parametrization; composite systems; Gell Mann matrices; partial trace; Quantum mechanics; reduced density matrix","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983399349"

The major strength of the proposed protocol is that all of the parameters are derived only from first principles because all of the information required is retrieved from quantum mechanical data, purposely computed for the investigated molecule. This a priori parametrization is carried out separately for the intra- and intermolecular contributions to the force fields, respectively exploiting the Joyce and Picky programs, previously developed in our group. To avoid high computational costs, all quantum mechanical calculations were performed exploiting the density functional theory. Because the choice of the functional is known to be crucial for the description of the intermolecular interactions, a specific procedure is proposed, which allows for a reliable benchmark of different functionals against higher-level data. The intramolecular and intermolecular contribution are eventually joined together, and the resulting quantum mechanically derived force field is thereafter employed in lengthy molecular dynamics simulations to compute several thermodynamic properties that characterize the resulting bulk phase. The accuracy of the proposed parametrization protocol is finally validated by comparing the computed macroscopic observables with the available experimental counterparts. It is found that, on average, the proposed approach is capable of yielding a consistent description of the investigated set, often outperforming the literature standard force fields, or at least delivering results of similar accuracy. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994765044"

The latter correction was obtained from internally contracted multireference coupled-cluster (icMRCC) theory. This composite approach has been used to obtain the dissociation energies and spectroscopic constants for the 60 molecules in our data set. In accordance with previous studies on a subset of molecules, we find that multireference corrections are rather small in many cases and CCSD(T) can provide accurate reference values, if the complete basis set limit is explored. In addition, the multireference correction improves the results in cases where CCSD(T) is not a good approximation. For a few cases, however, strong deviations from experiment persist, which cannot be explained by the remaining error in the computational approach. We suggest that these experimentally derived values require careful revision. This also shows that reliable reference values for benchmarking approximate computational methods are not always easily accessible via experiment and accurate computations may provide an alternative way to access them. In order to assess how the choice of reference data affects benchmark studies, we tested 10 DFT functionals for the molecules in the present data set against experimental and calculated reference values. Despite the differences between these two sets of reference values, we found that the ranking of the relative performance of the DFT functionals is nearly independent of the chosen reference. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034633782"

Then, using the attainable eigenvalues as a training set of the direct radial basis neural network a map of new eigenvalues was obtained. This relationship was later inverted and refined by training an inverse radial basis neural network, allowing the calculation of the unknown parameters and therefore estimating the potential function.

The synthesized silicon nanostructures were observed to absorb UV photons and subsequently reemit in a broad visible region extending from 450 to 650 nm. The incorporation of these nanostructures as a photon down-shifting layer on solar cells triggered improvements in the performance of the fabricated photovoltaic devices, especially in the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc). Specifically, the experimental results showed increments in the Voc from 532.6 to 536.2 mV and in the Jsc from 33.4 to 38.3 mA/cm2. The combined effect of those improved Voc and Jsc values led to an increment in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 11.9 to 13.4%. This increment represents an improvement of the order of 12.4% on the power conversion efficiency on the silicon solar cells employed.

We say a Bell inequality is normalized if its absolute value does not exceed 1 for any classical (i.e. local) distribution. Upper and (almost) tight lower bounds have been given in terms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the dimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized Bell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell inequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1 for any local distribution, including those that can abort. Both these families of Bell inequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We show how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum communication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication is proven using these lower bounds.

The main reason for these costs is the expansion of QTs by using tensor product in multi-dimension quantum applications. In this work, new optimizations for the execution of reduction and decomposition based on the Identity operator are introduced in the Distributed Geometric Machine framework (D-GM). Instead of executing the quantum transformation in a single step, they are divided in sub-quantum transformations and only the values different from Identity transformations are stored. Mixed Partial Processes provide control over the increase in the size of read/write memory states in the calculation of a QT, thus contributing to increase the scalability of applications regarding hardware-GPUs memory limit. In the evaluation of this D-GM extension, Hadamard Transformations were simulated up to 28 qubits applications over a single GPU.

Specifically, histone modifying and reading processes are the most broadly studied and are targeted by several licensed drugs. Although there have been significant advances in understanding the mechanistic aspects underlying epigenetic regulation, the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors remains a challenge. Experimentally, it is generally difficult to elucidate the atomistic basis for substrate recognition, as well as the sequence of events involved in binding and the subsequent chemical processes. In this regard, computational modelling is particularly valuable, since it can provide structural features (including transition state structures along with kinetic and thermodynamic parameters) that enable both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the mechanistic details involved. Here, we summarize knowledge gained from computational modelling studies elucidating the role of the protein environment in histone-lysine modifying and reading mechanisms.

We propose a solution in which we utilise off-The-shelf components in an affordable package, which is able to measure CF. The prototype that was built demonstrates the ability of discriminating between stressed and non-stressed plants, and shows potential as a low-cost fluorometer. As the focus is less on accuracy and more on relative results and cost, this opens up the possibility of using multiple sensors in a wireless sensor network (WSN).

As we discuss, we expect that these quantum fusion algorithms will have a better computational complexity than traditional fusion algorithms. This means that quantum computers could allow the efficient fusion of large data sets for complex multi-target tracking. On the other hand, (Quantum Data) Fusion refers to the fusion of quantum data that is being generated by quantum sensors. The output of the quantum sensors is considered in the form of qubits, and a quantum computer performs data fusion algorithms.

Currently, an effective vaccine for malaria does not exist, and chemotherapy must be used to treat the disease. Because of increasing resistance to current antimalarial drugs, new treatments must be developed. Among the many potential molecular targets, the hexose transporter of Plasmodium falciparum (PfHT) is particularly promising because it plays a vital role in glucose transport for the parasite. Thus, this study aims to determine the three-dimensional structure of PfHT and to describe the intermolecular interactions between active glycoside derivatives and PfHT. Such information should aid in the development of new antimalarial drugs. The receptor PfHT was constructed from primary sequences deposited in the SWISS MODEL database. Next, molecular docking simulations between O-(undec-10-en)-l-D-glucose and the constructed active site models were performed using Autodock Vina. The glycoside derivative-PfHT complexes were then refined using the hybrid QM/MM (PM3/ff03) method within the AMBER package. The models were then evaluated using Ramachandran plots, which indicated that 93.2% of the residues in the refined PfHT models (P5) were present in favorable regions. Furthermore, graphical plots using ANOLEA showed that the potential energies of interaction for atoms unbonded to P5 were negative. Finally, the O-(undec-10-en)-l-D-glucose-PfHT complex was evaluated using 20-ns Molecular Dynamics simulations with an ff03 force field. Docking and QM/MM studies revealed the amino acids essential for molecular recognition of and activity on glycosides. Inhibition of glucose transporters may prevent the development and metabolism of P. falciparum, so a description of the receptor's structure is a critical step towards rational drug design. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of the current state of physicochemical study of biological processes suggests that MM simulations based on empirical force fields have an ever-increasing impact on understanding the structure and functions of biomolecules. The problem of “classic mechanics” description of essentially quantum properties and processes is considered. Various approaches to a selection of force field mathematical expressions and parameters are reviewed. The relation between MM simplicity and “physical nature” of the properties and events is examined.

In the quantum gate array version, the use of convenient and proper gates is essential. While these gates adopt theoretically convenient forms to reproduce computational algorithms, their design and feasibility depend on specific quantum systems and physical resources used in their setup. These gates should be based on systems driven by physical interactions ruled by a quantum Hamiltonian. Then, the gate design is restricted to the properties and the limitations imposed by the interactions and the physical elements involved. This work shows how anisotropic Heisenberg-Ising interactions, written in a non-local basis, allow the reproduction of quantum computer operations based on unitary processes. We show that gates can be generated by a pulse sequence of driven magnetic fields. This fact states alternative techniques in quantum gate design for magnetic systems. A brief final discussion around associated fault tolerant extensions to the current work is included. © Rinton Press.","Gate design; Heisenberg-ising anisotropic model; Quantum algorithms; Unitary matrix factorization","Anisotropy; Cell proliferation; Factorization; Fault tolerant computer systems; Hamiltonians; Logic gates; Quantum channel; Quantum optics; Qubits; Anisotropic models; Computational algorithm; Gate design; Physical interactions; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Hamiltonians; Unitary factorization; Unitary matrix; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022225835"

In this project, a kinetic study of these reactions by applying quantum mechanics concepts, such as reaction force, force constant, and electronic reaction flow was proposed. Furthermore, absolute theoretical scales of electrophilicity by applying density functional theory electronic indices were established to classify a series of five and six-membered nitroheteroarenes, and nitrobenzenes with substituents in ortho, meta and para positions. The theoretical model was validated by comparison with experimental kinetic results. Calculations using B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory allowed analysis of the reactivity patterns and the mechanisms of these chemical reactions. The theoretical scale properly accounts for the activating/deactivating effects promoted by the substituents and agrees with the ability of these substituents to accept or donate electrons, electron acceptor substituents are those that increase electrophilicity, and electron donors those that reduce it. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","DFT; Electrophilic; Nitroarene; Nucleophilic substitution; Reaction mechanism; Vicarious","aromatic compound; chemical compound; functional group; heteroaromatic compound; nitrobenzene derivative; unclassified drug; Article; chemical reaction; chemical reaction kinetics; correlation coefficient; density functional theory; electron; electrophilicity; mathematical analysis; nucleophilicity; priority journal; quantum mechanics; reaction analysis; substitution reaction; theoretical model; validation study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030321061"

The protocol makes use of an entangled tripartite state shared by the controller and two further parties (users) who will perform standard teleportation. The goal of the protocol is to guarantee that the teleportation is successful only with the permission of the controller. Optical qubits based on either superpositions of vacuum and single-photon states or superposition of coherent states are employed here to encode a tripartite maximal slice state upon which the protocol is based. We compare the performances of these two encodings under losses which are present when the qubits are guided through an optical fiber to the users.

As a case study, we investigate the aggregation of heteropolymers bioinspired on Aβ25−33 fragments and their cross-seeding with IAPP20−29 isoforms. Excellent parallel scaling is observed, even under numerically difficult first-order like phase transitions, which are properly described by the built-in fully reconfigurable force fields.

The methodology is based on (i) ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, (ii) all-atom explicit solvation, (iii) the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model, and (iv) the use of electrostatic potentials as references for the absolute electrochemical scale. We apply the approach presented to compute reduction potentials of the following redox couples: Cr2+/3+, V2+/3+, Ru(NH3)62+/3+, Sn2+/4+, Cu1+/2+, FcMeOH0/1+, and Fe2+/3+ (in aqueous solution) and Fc0/1+ (in acetonitrile). We argue that fully quantum-mechanical simulations are required to correctly model the intricate dynamical effects of the charged complexes on the surrounding solvent molecules within the solvation shell. Using the proposed methodology allows for a computationally efficient and statistically stable approach to compute free energy differences, yielding excellent agreement between our computed redox potentials and the experimental references. The root-mean-square deviation with respect to experiment for the aqueous test set and the two exchange-correlation density functionals used, PBE and PBE with van der Waals corrections, are 0.659 and 0.457 V, respectively. At this level of theory, depending on the functional employed, its ability to correctly describe each particular molecular complex seems to be the factor limiting the accuracy of the calculations. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027228601"

With these two goals in mind, planar and nanotexturized c-Si photovoltaic devices were built and their radiation incident side was covered with CdTe quantum dots (QDs) dispersed in a poly-methyl-methacrylate thin film ~100 nm thick. The measured performance with and without the CdTe QD layer indicates that the down-shifting photoluminescence (DSPL) of the synthesized QDs triggers an increase in the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current, resulting in an overall improvement of ~1.5 % in the power conversion efficiency of the produced devices. This observation can be understood as a result of decreasing the number of high energy photons that are prone to unproductive near surface absorption in c-Si p-n junction solar cells and the re-emission of lower energy photons that are more effectively bulk-absorbed in c-Si solar cells. The result of lowering the near surface photon absorption represents a reduction of carrier losses due to the high surface recombination velocity as well as the low lifetime that normally plague the diffused side of an active junction device. Additionally, solar cells with a layer of CdTe QDs exhibit a higher external quantum efficiency when compared to devices without the aforementioned quantum dots. Layers of CdTe QDs are economically attractive, highly photostable and their absorption and emission spectra have a strong dependence on particle size, therefore, they lend themselves to providing a broad DSPL spectrum and promoting the proliferation of photovoltaic structures. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Absorption spectroscopy; Cadmium telluride; Conversion efficiency; Emission spectroscopy; Esters; Nanocrystals; Open circuit voltage; Particle size; Photons; Quantum efficiency; Semiconductor junctions; Silicon; Silicon solar cells; Solar cells; Thick film devices; Absorption and emission spectra; Cdte quantum dots (QDs); External quantum efficiency; Photovoltaic devices; Photovoltaic structures; Power conversion efficiencies; Solar cell performance; Surface recombination velocities; Semiconductor quantum dots","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950237545"

One small capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) was designed for high-resolution analog FPAs, as well as a novel mixed-signal architecture which has several advantages over the analog design, such as a wider dynamic range, a native digital output, a longer integration time and a faster system development. The read-out circuits were electrically tested at room temperature and liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K) and, later, were connected to a photovoltaic quantum-well infrared photodetector cooled at 10K to check the properties of the whole system. The CTIA performed as expected. The mixed-signal circuit appeared to be able to measure currents from pA to nA with a good linearity and low noise. The calculated resolution was about 50,000 e-/bit, and integration times from milliseconds to a few seconds could be reached without any saturation.

Using quantum control methods, we consider several optimization problems whose global solutions realize the gate in a chain of three qubits with XY Heisenberg interaction. Applying a minimum number of control pulses assuring a fidelity above 99 % in the ideal case, we design stable gates that are less sensitive to variations in the interqubits couplings. The most stable gate has the fidelity above 91 % with variations about 0.1 %, for up to 10 % variation in the nominal couplings. We perturb the system by introducing a single source of 1 / f noise that affects all the couplings. In order to quantify the performance of the proposed optimized gates, we calculate the fidelity of a large set of optimized gates under prescribed levels of coupling perturbation. Then, we run multifractal analysis on the sequence of attained fidelities. This way, gate performance can be assessed beyond mere average results, since the chosen multifractality measure (the width of the multifractal spectrum) encapsulates into a single performance indicator the spread of fidelity values around the mean and the presence of outliers. The higher the value of the performance indicator the more concentrated around the mean the fidelity values are and rarer is the occurrence of outliers. The results of the multifractal analysis on the fidelity sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimized gate implementations, in the sense they are rendered less sensitive to variations in the interqubits coupling strengths. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Quantum computation; Quantum control; Time series analysis","Benchmarking; Control theory; Couplings; Fractals; Optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Statistics; Time series analysis; Coupling strengths; Global solutions; Heisenberg interaction; Multi-fractal spectrum; Multifractal analysis; Optimization problems; Performance indicators; Quantum control; Reconfigurable hardware","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980028590"

Of these methods, the MOdified Separation of Cohesive Energy Density (MOSCED) has recently been shown to correlate well the equilibrium solubility of multifunctional non-electrolyte solids. However, before it can be applied to a novel solute, a limited amount of reference solubility data is required to regress the necessary MOSCED parameters. Here we demonstrate for the solutes methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, lidocaine and ephedrine how conventional molecular simulation free energy calculations or electronic structure calculations in a continuum solvent, here the SMD or SM8 solvation model, can instead be used to generate the necessary reference data, resulting in a predictive flavor of MOSCED. Adopting the melting point temperature and enthalpy of fusion of these compounds from experiment, we are able to predict equilibrium solubilities. We find the method is able to well correlate the (mole fraction) equilibrium solubility in non-aqueous solvents over four orders of magnitude with good quantitative agreement. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Activity coefficient; Chemical potential; Electronic structure; Free energy of solvation; Molecular simulation; Solubility","Computer Simulation; Molecular Structure; Parabens; Quantum Theory; Solubility; Solutions; Solvents; Thermodynamics; Electrolytes; Free energy; Molecular structure; Solubility; Solvation; Solvents; butyl paraben; ephedrine; ethyl paraben; lidocaine; methyl paraben; propyl paraben; solvent; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; solution and solubility; solvent; Cohesive energy density; Electronic structure calculations; Electronic.structure; Energy of solvation; Equilibrium solubilities; Free energy of solvation; Free-energy calculations; Molecular simulations; Solubility data; Solubility parameters; Article; energy; enthalpy; flavor; melting point; priority journal; simulation; solubility; solvation; temperature; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; quantum theory; solubility; solution and solubility; thermodynamics; Electronic structure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010943927"

They provide means to extract information about the repartition of the electronic density among molecules or solids. The values of atomic multipoles in a molecule can shed light on its electrostatic properties and may help to predict how different molecules could interact or to rationalize chemical reactivity for instance. Not being physical observables to which a quantum mechanical operator can be associated, atomic charges and higher order atomic multipoles cannot be defined unambiguously in a molecule, and therefore, several population schemes (PS) have been devised in the last decades. In the context of density functional theory (DFT), PS based on the electron density seem to be best grounded. In particular, some groups have proposed various iterative schemes the outcomes of which are very encouraging. Modern implementations of DFT that are for example based on density fitting techniques permit the investigation of molecular systems comprising of hundreds of atoms. However, population analyses following iterative schemes may become very CPU time consuming for such large systems. In this article, we investigate if the computationally less expensive analyses of the variationally fitted electronic densities can be safely carried out instead of the Kohn-Sham density. It is shown that as long as flexible auxiliary function sets including f and g functions are used, the multipoles extracted from the fitted densities are extremely close to those obtained from the KS density. We further assess if the multipoles obtained through the Hirshfeld’s approach, in its standard or iterative form, can be a useful approach to calculate interaction energies in non-covalent complexes. Relative energies computed with the AMOEBA polarizable forced field combined to iterative Hirshfeld multipoles are encouraging. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","AMOEBA; Charges; deMon2k; Density Fitting; Hirshfeld","accuracy; Article; calculation; chemical analysis; density functional theory; dipole; molecule; priority journal; quantum chemistry; static electricity; article; human","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014555713"

The MQ problem was proved by Patarin et al.'s to be NP-complete. Although the basic HFE has been proved to be vulnerable to attacks, its variants obtained by some modifications have been proved to be stronger against attacks. The Quartz digital signature scheme based on the HFEv-trapdoor (a variant of HFE) with particular choices of parameters, has been shown to be stronger against algebraic attacks to recover the private key. Furthermore, it generates reasonably short signatures. However, Joux et al. proved (based on the Birthday Paradox Attack) that Quartz is malleable in the sense that, if an adversary gets a valid pair of message and signature, a valid signature to another related message is obtainable with 250 computations and 250 queries to the signing oracle. Currently, the recommended minimum security level is 2112. Our signature scheme is also based on Quartz but we achieve a 2112 security level against Joux et al.'s attack. It is also more efficient in signature verification and vector initializations. Furthermore, we implemented both the original and our improved Quartz signature and run empirical comparisons.

The optimization is achieved by computing the Nagaoka's Free Energy Gradient (FEG) within an Average Solvent Electrostatic Configuration (ASEC) atomistic representation of the thermodynamic equilibrium and minimizing such quantity via an iterative procedure based on sequential classical MD and constrained QM/MM geometry optimization steps. The performance of such an ASEC-FEG protocol is assessed at the CASPT2//CASSCF/Amber level by reproducing the λmax values observed for 12 mutants of redesigned human cellular retinol binding protein II (hCRBPII) systems; a set of 10 distant wild-type rhodopsins from vertebrates, invertebrates, eubacteria, and archaea organisms; and finally a set of 10 rhodopsin mutants from an eubacterial rhodopsin. The results clearly show that the proposed protocol, which can be easily extended to any protein incorporating a covalently bound ligand, yields correct λmax trends with limited absolute errors. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","","Animals; Humans; Hydrogen Bonding; Lignans; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis; Quantum Theory; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular; Rhodopsin; Static Electricity; Thermodynamics; cellular retinol binding protein; lignan; rhodopsin; animal; chemistry; genetics; human; hydrogen bond; metabolism; molecular model; mutagenesis; quantum theory; static electricity; thermodynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038232729"

Independently from quantum cognition, quantum approaches for the semantics of music interpretation and improvisation have been proposed in the context of quantum computational logic and standard quantum mechanics, respectively. These frameworks overcome the non-contextual and compositional approaches to the semantics of music. In this paper, we analyze the quantum approach to the semantics of music from the perspective of quantum cognition. We first introduce an operational framework, inspired by the Brussels–Geneva approach to the foundations of quantum theory, named state context property (SCoP) formalism, that has been applied in quantum cognition to model concepts. Next, we show that the quantum approaches to the semantics of music can be operationalized in SCoP. In particular, we apply the SCoP definitions of ‘orthogonal property’ and ‘experiment-context’ to operationalize the notions of ‘vague meaning’ and ‘interpretation’, and to characterize the structural differences between the semantics of music interpretation and improvisation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Musical semantics; Non-compositionality; Quantum cognition; SCoP; Theory of concepts","Computation theory; Logic programming; Semantics; Compositionality; Computational logic; Orthogonal property; Quantum cognition; SCoP; Structural differences; Theory of concepts; Traditional approaches; Quantum theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946123055"

This was done implementing the collisional model proposed in [2] to investigate the non- Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system interacting with a carefully controlled environment state. We also observed the transition from weak to strong (essentially) non-Markovianity. In our all-optical setup, a single photon system, initially entangled in polarization with an ancilla, is made to interact with a sequence of liquid crystal retarders driven by proper electric pulses, which simulates the environment. Depending on how the voltage is applied on each liquid crystal, it will work as a half-wave plate with different orientations. Then, by changing properly the parameters of the qubit-environment interactions, the system dynamics can suffer a transition from weak to strong non-Markovianity. In the strong regime, the full reconstruction of the entangled state was made by single entanglement witness between system and ancilla, showing a backflow of information, while, in the weak regime, given the contractive unital map feature, we can only measure the dynamics by a full process tomography analysis, searching for the violation of the divisibility completely positive map criterion, what was done successfully. © 2015 SPIE.","Collision; Completely positive map; Concurrence; Environment; Interaction channel; Liquid crystal; Strong non-Markovianity; Weak non-Markovianity","Crystal orientation; Dynamics; Liquid crystals; Liquids; Particle beams; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Search engines; Tomography; Collision; Completely positive map; Concurrence; Environment; Interaction channel; Strong non-Markovianity; Weak non-Markovianity; Quantum theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943398324"

This method can be applied in the development of optical filters and optical sensors to process, analyze and choose the passband of the propagation modes of an optical pulse from an non-Hermitian optical system. Non-Hermitian optical systems can be used to develop optical fiber sensors that suppress certain propagation modes of optical pulses that eventually behave as quantum noise. Such systems are described by the Nonlinear Schrödinger-like Equation with Parity-Time (PT) Symmetric Optical Potentials. There are optical fiber sensors that due to high laser intensity and frequency can produce quantum noise, such as Raman and Brillouin scattering. However, the optical fiber, for example, can be designed so that its geometry suppress certain propagation modes of the beam. We apply some results of non-Hermitian optical systems with PT symmetry to simulate optical lattice by a appropriate potential function, which among other applications, can naturally suppress certain propagation modes of an optical beam propagating through a waveguide. In other words, the optical system is modeled by a potential function in the Nonlinear Schrödinger-like Equation that one relates with the geometric aspects of the wave guides and with the optical beam interacting with the waveguide material. The paper is organized as follows: sections 1 and 2 present a brief description about nonlinear optical systems and non-Hermitian optical systems with PT symmetry. Section 3 presents a description of the dynamics of nonlinear optical pulses propagating through optical networks described by a optical potential non-Hermitian. Sections 4 and 5 present a general description of this non-Hermitian optical systems and how to get them from a more general model.

Forecast models are designed with two to five qubits, which represent 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-day historical data respectively. Ising model's real-valued weights and dimensionless coefficients are calculated using daily mean air temperatures from 119 places around the world as well as sea level (Aburatsu, Japan). In comparison with current methods, this approach is better suited to predict the heat wave values because it does not require the estimation of a probability distribution from scarce observations. The proposed forecast quantum computing algorithm is simulated based on traditional computer architecture and combinatorial optimization of Ising model parameters for the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport dataset with 1-day lead-time on learning sample (1975-2010 yr). Analysis of the forecast accuracy (ratio of successful predictions to total number of predictions) on the validation sample (2011-2014 yr) shows that Ising model with three qubits has 100% accuracy, which is significant as compared to other methods. However, number of identified heat waves is small (only one out of nineteen in this case). Other models with 2, 4, and 5 qubits have 20%, 3.8%, and 3.8% accuracy respectively. The presented three-qubit forecast model is applied for the prediction of heat waves at other five locations: Aurel Vlaicu, Romania - accuracy is 28.6%; Bratislava, Slovakia - accuracy is 21.7%; Brussels, Belgium - accuracy is 33.3%; Sofia, Bulgaria - accuracy is 50%; Akhisar, Turkey - accuracy is 21.4%. These predictions are not ideal, but not zeros. They can be used independently or together with other predictions generated by different method(s). The loss of human life as well as environmental, economic and material damage from extreme air temperatures could be reduced if some of heat waves are predicted. Even a small success rate implies a large socio-economic benefit. © 2015 IEEE.","D-Wave; forecast; heat wave; Ising mode; quantum computing","Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Combinatorial optimization; Computer architecture; Information science; Ising model; Probability distributions; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Sea level; Brussels , Belgium; Forecast accuracy; Heat waves; Ising mode; Learning samples; Mean air temperatures; Quantum Computing; Socio-economic benefits; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960374641"

Therefore, this books is particularly suited to students and researchers willing to grasp fundamental concepts in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information areas. The field of Quantum Information Theory has increased significantly over the last three decades. Many results from classical information theory were translated and extended to a scenario where quantum effects become important. Most of the results in this area allows for an asymptotically small probability of error to represent and transmit information efficiently. Claude E.Shannon was the first scientist to realize that error-free classical information transmission can be accomplished under certain conditions. More recently, the concept of error-free classical communication was translated to the quantum context. The so-called Quantum Zero-Error Information Theory completes and extends the Shannon Zero-Error Information Theory. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Computation theory; Errors; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Classical communication; Classical information; Fundamental concepts; Of quantum-information; Probability of errors; Quantum effects; Quantum Information; Zero error information; Information theory","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017063467"

We present a derivation of an accurate potential for formamide, with a functional form based on the OPLS/AA force field. Our procedure follows the approach introduced by Salas et al. (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015, 11, 683-693) that relies on ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We consider several strategies to derive the atomic charges of formamide. We find that the inclusion of polarization effects in the quantum mechanical computations is essential to obtain reliable force fields. By varying the atomic charges and the Lennard-Jones parameters describing the dispersion interactions in the OPLS/AA force field, we derive an optimum set of parameters that provides accurate results for the dielectric constant, surface tension, and bulk density of liquid formamide in a wide range of thermodynamic states. We test the transferability of our parameters to investigate liquid/liquid mixtures. We have chosen as case study an equimolar mixture of formamide and hexan-2-one. This mixture involves two fluids with very different polar characteristics, namely, large differences in their dielectric constants and their performance as solvents. The new potential predicts a liquid/liquid phase separation, in good agreement with experimental data, and highlights the importance of the correct parametrization of the pure liquid phases to investigate liquid mixtures. Finally, we examine the microscopic origin of the observed inmiscibility between formamide and hexa-2-one. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931282067"

The analysis was performed not only on the total electron density of the hydrogen bonded complexes but also on the intermediate electron density differences derived from the Morokuma energy decomposition scheme. Through the connection between these intermediate electron density differences and the corresponding differences in topological parameters, the meaning of topological parameters variation due to hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) becomes evident. Thus, for example, we show in a plausible way that the potential energy density differences at the H-bond critical point properly describe the electrostatics of H-bonding, and local kinetic energy density differences account for the localization/delocalization degree of the electrons at that point. The results also support the idea that the total electronic energy density differences at the H-bond critical point describe the strength of the interaction rather than its covalent character as is commonly considered. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Difference density; Energy decomposition; Hydrogen bonds; Morokuma; QTAIM","Computer Simulation; Dimerization; Electrons; Energy Transfer; Formamides; Hydrogen Bonding; Isomerism; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Static Electricity; Structure-Activity Relationship; dimer; formamide; formamide derivative; Article; chemical structure; complex formation; decomposition; density; electron; energy; hydrogen bond; quantum theory; quantum theory of atoms in molecule; static electricity; tautomer; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; dimerization; energy transfer; hydrogen bond; isomerism; structure activity relation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84912139528"

San Manuel, 14 Sur y Av. San Claudio, Puebla, 72530, Mexico","DensToolKit is a suite of cross-platform, optionally parallelized, programs for analyzing the molecular electron density (ρ) and several fields derived from it. Scalar and vector fields, such as the gradient of the electron density (δρ), electron localization function (ELF) and its gradient, localized orbital locator (LOL), region of slow electrons (RoSE), reduced density gradient, localized electrons detector (LED), information entropy, molecular electrostatic potential, kinetic energy densities K and G, among others, can be evaluated on zero, one, two, and three dimensional grids. The suite includes a program for searching critical points and bond paths of the electron density, under the framework of Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. DensToolKit also evaluates the momentum space electron density on spatial grids, and the reduced density matrix of order one along lines joining two arbitrary atoms of a molecule. The source code is distributed under the GNU-GPLv3 license, and we release the code with the intent of establishing an open-source collaborative project. The style of DensToolKit's code follows some of the guidelines of an object-oriented program. This allows us to supply the user with a simple manner for easily implement new scalar or vector fields, provided they are derived from any of the fields already implemented in the code. In this paper, we present some of the most salient features of the programs contained in the suite, some examples of how to run them, and the mathematical definitions of the implemented fields along with hints of how we optimized their evaluation. We benchmarked our suite against both a freely-available program and a commercial package. Speed-ups of ∼2×, and up to 12× were obtained using a non-parallel compilation of DensToolKit for the evaluation of fields. DensToolKit takes similar times for finding critical points, compared to a commercial package. Finally, we present some perspectives for the future development and growth of the suite. Program summary Program title: DensToolKit Catalogue identifier: AEXI-v1-0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEXI-v1-0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU, General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 142037 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 5517409 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++, bash. Computer: Any. Operating system: Linux, MacOSX, Windows (cygwin). RAM: The memory requirements grow quadratically with the number of primitives describing the wavefunction. A wavefunction with 1,500 primitives uses ∼17MB, and 2GB RAM are enough to process wavefunctions of around 10,000 primitives. A few more MB may be needed by some of the most demanding programs of the package if the number of primitives is large. Classification: 6.5, 7.3, 16, 16.1. External routines: (optional) gnuplot, povray, epstool, Graphics-Magick, epstopdf Nature of problem: The study of the electron density of molecules, some reactivity indices, and the topology of the electron density can be used to analyze the chemical nature, stability and reactivity of those molecules. Furthermore, the study of the electron density and functionals of it may help us in gaining a better understanding of the chemical bond. Reactivity indices and the molecular topological properties may also aid in molecular design. Solution method: The suite provides several programs in order to compute scalar and vector fields derivatives of the electron density. Those fields are obtained from a wavefunction file, which is in turn obtained from programs such as Nwchem, MolPro, etc. The functions, whereby the fields are computed, are implemented following mathematically standard but computationally optimized and parallelized algorithms built upon the Density Matrix. The suite provides several small but efficient programs, easily scriptable, for evaluation of the fields upon spatial grids. Regarding the topology analysis, the suite uses the algorithm proposed by Popelier, which uses the eigen-values of the Hessian of the electron density for locating the critical points. Bond paths are traced using a fifth-order Runge-Kutta-Dormand-Prince algorithm. Optional visualization of the produced data can be carried out by scripts generated by the suite, which can be parsed later to gnuplot, or povray. In addition, DensToolKit provides an open door for the user to program new scalar or vector fields, with almost complete functionality for evaluating such fields upon the same spatial grids as those implemented for the fields already provided in the suite. Restrictions: Wavefunctions with more than 99 nuclei must be input in wfx format. In the current version, wavefunctions that use pseudopotentials must have only one Additional Electron Density Function (EDF) entry in the wfx file, which in this case is the only accepted input format, and pseudopotential support is provided only in non-parallel compilation. Additional comments: A simple method for implementing new indices (derived from any of the implemented fields) is provided. In this manner, the final user may easily program his/her own scalar or vector field with a few code lines. Running time: Strongly dependent on the number of primitives used for approximating the wavefunction (∼N2p). It also depends on the evaluated number of points and type of field. Wavefunctions comprised of 1,500 primitives may take several hours to complete, while small molecules described by two or three hundred primitives take a few seconds. Typical running times are at least as fast as the times taken by some commercial or freely available codes. In many cases, the programs perform the computations with a speed-up of 2× (with respect to other available programs), and in some cases 10× speed-ups or more can be attained. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Electron density; Momentum space; Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules; Reactivity indices; Reduced density matrix of order one; Spatial grids","Atoms; Carrier concentration; Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Codes (symbols); Data visualization; Electric furnaces; Electron density measurement; Electrons; Function evaluation; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Linux; Matrix algebra; Molecules; Momentum; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Open systems; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Random access storage; Runge Kutta methods; Software testing; Topology; Vectors; Windows operating system; Momentum spaces; Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules; Reactivity indices; Reduced-density matrix; Spatial grids; C++ (programming language)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942196393"

Here, we show that if A is positive under partial transposition (PPT) or symmetric with positive coefficients (SPCs) or invariant under realignment, then its associated self-adjoint map is completely reducible. We give applications of this fact in quantum information theory. We recover some theorems (recently proved for PPT and SPC matrices), and we prove them for matrices invariant under realignment using theorems of the Perron-Frobenius theory. We also provide a new proof of the fact that if Ck contains k mutually unbiased bases, then there exists another orthonormal basis which is mutually unbiased with these k bases. We study other types of matrices that could have the same property. We consider a collection of linear transformations acting on Mk ⊗ Mk, which contains the partial transpositions and the realignment map. For each linear transformation, we consider the set of matrices in Mk ⊗ Mk ≃ Mk2 that are positive and remain positive, or invariant, under the action of this linear transformation. Within this family of sets, we have the set of PPT matrices, the set of SPC matrices and the set of matrices invariant under realignment.

A critical value for the EMF was found, around B(c)ext,z ∼39 mT, which characterizes two regimes of behavior of the thermal entanglement. Our results show that the DM term acts as a facilitator for the entanglement because it prolongs the nonzero thermal entanglement for larger temperatures. We found that the concurrence as a function of the temperature has a local maximum, for values of the magnetic field larger than the critical field. We also show that the critical temperature T c follows a polynomial growth as a function of the DM term, with characteristic behavior Tc∼ β02, and the hyperfine field implies a critical temperature as a function of the field variance, σ of the form Tc ∼ σ2.

To this end, the automated Picky procedure (Cacelli et al. J. Comput. Chem. 2012, 33, 1055) was exploited, which consists in parametrizing specific intermolecular force fields through an iterative approach, based on the comparison with quantum mechanical data. For each of the tested functionals, the resulting force field was employed in classical Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations, performed on systems of up to 1000 molecules in ambient conditions, to calculate a number of condensed phase properties. The comparison of the resulting structural and dynamic properties with experimental data allows us to assess the quality of each IPES and, consequently, even the quality of the DFT functionals. The methodology is tested on the benzene dimer, commonly used as a benchmark molecule, a prototype of aromatic interactions. The best results were obtained with the CAM-B3LYP-D3 functional. Besides assessing the reliability of DFT functionals in describing aromatic IPESs, this work provides a further step toward a robust protocol for the derivation of sound force field parameters from quantum mechanical data. This method can be relevant in all those cases where standard force fields fail in giving accurate predictions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","Benzene; Dimerization; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Quantum Theory; Reproducibility of Results; benzene; chemistry; dimerization; molecular dynamics; quantum theory; reproducibility","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946944455"

Moreover, it is conjectured that quantum sidelobe structures may be used to detect targets oriented off the specular direction. Because of the high data bandwidth expected from quantum radar, it may be necessary to use sophisticated quantum signal analysis algorithms to determine the presence of stealth targets through the sidelobe structures.

Nevertheless, the entangled resource may be afflicted by local noise, affecting its ability to serve as the entangled resource for quantum teleportation. We obtain experimental data on the influence of different local environments on the ability of an initially entangled pair of qubits to act as a teleportation resource, after it has been disturbed by noise. We generate selected conditions on the noise parameter space, both theoretically and experimentally, and we find that an already noisy protocol can be made practically insensitive to a further addition of noise. The experimental results are based on a photonic implementation of the quantum teleportation algorithm, with a polarization-entangled pair acting as the quantum resource. The state to be teleported is an additional qubit encoded in the path internal degree of freedom of Alice's photon. Interactions with different local environments on both sides of the system are either implemented with an extra qubit as the environment, or simulated as a weighed average of pure states. We compare our experimental results with the theoretical predictions, and by performing quantum process tomography we can calculate the fidelity of the quantum teleportation scheme and evaluate the effect of local environments. © 2015 SPIE.","decoherence; entanglement; open quantum systems; quantum communication; quantum teleportation","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Decoherence; entanglement; Experimental investigations; Local environment effects; Local environments; Open quantum systems; Quantum process tomography; Quantum teleportation; Quantum entanglement","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960846933"

Both calculi are algebraic: each one is equipped with an additive and a scalar-multiplicative structure, and their set of terms is closed under linear combinations. However, the two languages were built using different approaches: the former is a call-by-name language whereas the latter is call-by-value; the former considers algebraic equalities whereas the latter approaches them through rewrite rules.; In this paper, we analyse how these different approaches relate to one another. To this end, we propose four canonical languages based on each of the possible choices: call-byname versus call-by-value, algebraic equality versus algebraic rewriting. We show that the various languages simulate one another. Due to subtle interaction between beta-reduction and algebraic rewriting, to make the languages consistent some additional hypotheses such as confluence or normalisation might be required. We carefully devise the required properties for each proof, making them general enough to be valid for any sub-language satisfying the corresponding properties. © A. Assaf, A. Díaz-Caro, S.

Reductions are achieved by avoiding replication and sparsity inherited from such operators.

For the reduction of the computational cost in the geometry optimization calculations, the PBE-D2 and the GGA + U methodologies were tested, even as the 4f electrons treatment, in the core and in the valence shell of the lanthanide metals. As a result of the electronic structure calculations, the lattice parameters of these complexes was obtained and corroborated by a comparison between the simulated and experimental diffractograms. The projected density of states and the charge density analysis were made for a better understanding of the electronic structure and the stabilization of these complexes, like the importance of some ligands and the difference of the interaction between the rare-earth metals and the ligands. It could be concluded that there is no need to compute the spin polarization and to include the hubbard correction in order to conduct a structural analysis of these rare-earth metal complexes. The electronic density maps show that the structures are mainly stabilized by charge transfer between the ligands and the rare-earth cations. This result also corroborates the geometry optimizations performed with the DFT-D2 method, which indicate that the computation of the Van der Waals forces are negligible. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this year we put our main efforts to understanding and generalizing vortices-two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantum objects carrying angular momentum- from the perspective of the many-body physics. We have studied static properties and quantum dynamics of vortices confined in simple parabolic traps and in circular traps. Particular emphasis has been put on the loss of coherence and build-up of the fragmentation. Complimentary, we continue to develop the MCTDHB method spanning several directions of the theoretical and computational physics as well as optimal-control theory: (a) the linear-response on-top of theMCTDHB method (LRMCTDHB) has been reformulated in a compact block form, expanded for general inter-particle interactions, and benchmarked against the exactly-solvable harmonicinteraction model; (b) a new analysis tool capable of simulating the outcomes of typical shots generated in the experimental detection of ultra-cold atomic systems has been invented, tested, and applied; (c) a novel algorithm offering a direct quantitativemeasurement of the possible fragmentation in bosonic systems has been proposed and applied; (d) the optimal-control Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) algorithm has been merged with the MCTDHB package and applied to manipulate quantum systems.

In this work, we show the conditions upon which coined QWs are equivalent to Szegedy’s QWs. Those QW models have in common a large class of instances, in the sense that the evolution operators are equal when we convert the graph on which the coined QW takes place into a bipartite graph on which Szegedy’s QW takes place, and vice versa.

The first is to use toolboxes of quantum functions to determine the geometric component of the RCS. The second idea is to use quantum walks, expressed in terms of scattering processes, to model radar absorbing materials. © 2016 SPIE.","Quantum computation; Quantum information; Radar; Radar absorbing materials; Radar cross sections; Scattering matrix; Sensing","Characterization; Computational electromagnetics; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Radar; Radar absorbing materials; Radar equipment; Computational resources; Electromagnetic phenomena; Mathematical descriptions; Of quantum-information; Quantum Information; Scattering matrices; Sensing; Target characterization; Radar cross section","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982252194"

The analysis is based on the quantification of the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio from an optical phase image. The calculation of the SNR is based on the relation of the median (average) and standard deviation measurements over specific areas of interest in the phase images of both sensors. This retrieved phase is coming from the vibrational behavior of a large object by means of an out-of-plane holographic interferometer. The SNR is used as a figure-of-merit to evaluate and compare the performance of the CMOS and scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera as part of the experimental set-up. One of the cameras has a high speed CMOS sensor while the other has a high resolution sCMOS sensor. The object under study is a metallically framed table with a Formica cover with an observable area of 1.1 m2. The vibration induced to the sample is performed by a linear step motor with an attached tip in the motion stage. Each camera is used once at the time to record the deformation keeping the same experimental conditions for each case. These measurements may complement the conventional procedures or technical information commonly used to evaluate a camerás performance such as: quantum efficiency, spatial resolution and others. Results present post processed images from both cameras, but showing a smoother and easy to unwrap optical phase coming from those recorded with the sCMOS camera. © Copyright 2015 SPIE.","digital holographic interferometry; imaging detectors; Interferometry","Cameras; CMOS integrated circuits; Holographic interferometry; Holography; Interferometry; Melamine formaldehyde resins; Nondestructive examination; Speckle; Stepping motors; Units of measurement; Digital holographic interferometry; Experimental conditions; Experimental set up; Imaging detector; Imaging performance; Post-processed images; Technical information; Vibrational behavior; Signal to noise ratio","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943526703"

The flux level at Earth during the first and last phase is of order 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 over the energy range 0.3-2.5 keV. These values are higher than an upper limit obtained in September 1990 with ROSAT. The nova thus continued fading in the soft band (0.1-2.4 keV). The nova turned off some time between days 301.9 and 371, and the X-ray flux subsequently decreased from day 301.9-526, following an exponential decline time scale of (96 ± 3) days. We use the absorption lines present in the SSS spectrum for diagnostic purposes, and characterize the physics and the dynamics of the expanding atmosphere during the explosion of the nova. The information extracted from this first stage is then used as input for computing full photoionization models of the ejecta in V4743 Sgr. The SSS spectrum is modeled with a simple black-body and multiplicative Gaussian lines, which provides us of a general kinematical picture of the system, before it decays to its faint phase (Ness et al. 2003). In the grating spectra taken between days 180.4 and 370, we can resolve the line profiles of absorption lines arising from H-like and He-like C, N, and O, including transitions involving higher principal quantum numbers. Except for a few interstellar lines, all lines are significantly blue-shifted, yielding velocities between 1000 and 6000 km s-1 which implies an ongoing mass loss. It is shown that significant expansion and mass loss occur during this phase of the explosion, at a rate Ṁ ≈ (3-5) × 10-4 (L/L38) Mȯ/yr. Our measurements show that the efficiency of the amount of energy used for the motion of the ejecta, defined as the ratio between the kinetic luminosity Lkin and the radiated luminosity Lrad, is of the order of one. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Luminance; Quantum theory; Absorption lines; Astrophysical fluids; High resolution; Photoionization models; Photospheric emission; Principal quantum numbers; X ray spectrum; X-ray observations; Absorption spectroscopy","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978804595"

The McEliece cryptosystem is an example of code-based cryptography which is an alternative to the most popular and commercial cryptosystems nowadays as it is believed to be immune to quantum computing. It has simple and fast algorithms, but its drawback is the size of the keys it has to deal with. By substituting the Goppa codes of the McEliece original proposal by LDPC and MDPC codes it's possible to achieve much smaller keys. And by applying programming technics such as parallelization of operations and also utilizing efficient decoders of LDPC codes it's possible to achieve really good results and optimal performances of the code-based cryptosystem showing that it really has to be considered as a strong substitute to RSA and DSA as quantum computers emerge to easily compute discrete logarithms and factor large integers. © 2015 IEEE.","Code-based cryptography; Coding-theory; Efficient decoding; Post-quantum cryptography","Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Computer programming; Decoding; Integer programming; Optimal systems; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum efficiency; Code-based cryptography; Coding Theory; Discrete logarithms; McEliece cryptosystem; Optimal performance; Optimized implementation; Post quantum cryptography; Quantum Computing; Cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938303877"

To address these issues, assuming the availability of quantum computers capable of performing Grover search, we explore their constructive influence on post-quantum cryptography. In particular, we show how a reasonably small quantum computer can assist in generating secure Courtois-Finiasz-Sendrier (CFS) signatures based on Goppa codes.

Our ab initio approaches allow for the treatment of a few-body problem with bosonic statistics and strong interparticle interaction. The numerical implementation is based on the Lanczos algorithm for the diagonalization of large, but sparse symmetric Floquet matrices. We analyze the scheme efficiency in terms of the computational time, which is shown to scale polynomially with the size of the system. The numerically computed eigensystem is applied to the analysis of the Floquet Hamiltonian describing our problem. We show that this allows, for instance, for the efficient detection and characterization of avoided crossings and their statistical analysis. We finally compare the efficiency of our Lanczos diagonalization for computing the temporal evolution of our many-body system with an explicit fourth order Runge-Kutta integration. Both implementations heavily exploit efficient matrix-vector multiplication schemes. Our results should permit an extrapolation of the applicability of exact methods to increasing sizes of generic many-body quantum problems with bosonic statistics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The L,D-transpeptidase enzyme catalyzes the formation of 3 → 3 peptidoglycan cross-links of the Mtb cell wall and facilitates resistance against classical β-lactams. Herein, the experimentally proposed mechanism for LdtMt2 was studied by performing QM/MM MD simulations. The whole mechanistic process includes two stages: acylation and deacylation. During the acylation step, two steps were observed: the first step is a thiolate/imidazole ion-pair in the zwitterionic form, and the second step is the nucleophilic attack on the carboxyl carbon of the natural substrate accompanied by the breaking of the peptide bond on substrate. In the deacylation step the acyl-enzyme suffers a nucleophilic attack on the carboxyl carbon by the amine group of the second substrate. Our free energy results obtained by PMF analysis reveal that the first step (acylation) is the rate-limiting step in the whole catalytic mechanism in accordance with the experimental proposal. Also, the residues responsible for binding of the substrate and transition state stabilization were identified by energy decomposition methods. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","","Biocatalysis; Drug Design; Models, Molecular; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Peptidyl Transferases; Quantum Theory; Acylation; Amides; Carbon; Enzymes; Free energy; peptidyltransferase; Catalytic mechanisms; Computational approach; Energy decomposition; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nucleophilic attack; QM/MM MD simulations; Rate-limiting steps; Transition state stabilization; biocatalysis; chemical structure; drug design; enzymology; metabolism; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; quantum theory; Catalysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84916613028"

Speed and fidelity of transfer are the main objectives which have to be achieved by the devices even in the presence of imperfections which are unavoidable in any manufacturing process. To reach these goals, several kinds of spin chains have been suggested, which differ in the degree of fine-tuning, or engineering, of the system parameters. In this work we present a systematic study of two important classes of such chains. In one class only the spin couplings at the ends of the chain have to be adjusted to a value different from the bulk coupling constant, while in the other class every coupling has to have a specific value. We demonstrate that configurations from the two different classes may perform similarly when subjected to the same kind of disorder in spite of the large difference in the engineering effort necessary to prepare the system. We identify the system features responsible for these similarities and we perform a detailed study of the transfer fidelity as a function of chain length and disorder strength, yielding empirical scaling laws for the fidelity which are similar for all kinds of chain and all disorder models. These results are helpful in identifying the optimal spin chain for a given quantum information transfer task. In particular, they help in judging whether it is worthwhile to engineer all couplings in the chain as compared to adjusting only the boundary couplings. © Rinton Press.","Decoherence; Mesocopic echoes; Perfect state transfer; Quantum channels; Quantum information; Spin dynamics","Couplings; Quantum channel; Quantum optics; Spin dynamics; Decoherence; Manufacturing process; Mesocopic; Of quantum-information; Quantum Information; Quantum information transfer; Quantum state transfers; State transfer; Spin fluctuations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921978767"

QCA is a promising nanotechnology where components have nano size, ultra-low power consumption and could have a clock rate on terahertz rate. The architecture of our processor was inspired by the one used on the first carbon nanotube computer. We used this work as reference because both nanotechnology (the carbon nanotube and QCA) are promising and able to overcome the limits of current CMOS technology. Our work is the first implementation of a SUBNEG processor in QCA technology and, moreover, satisfies all constraints in order to make it robust. In a bottom-up approach, we first describe the building blocks that compose the QCA SUBNEG processor such as the ALU and the data and instruction memories.

Here, we focus on the optical PT -symmetric dimer, a two-waveguide coupler where the materials show symmetric effective gain and loss, and provide a review of the linear and nonlinear optical realizations from a symmetry-based point of view. We go beyond a simple review of the literature and show that the dimer is just the smallest of a class of planar N-waveguide couplers that are the optical realization of the Lorentz group in 2 + 1 dimensions. Furthermore, we provide a formulation to describe light propagation through waveguide couplers described by non-Hermitian mode coupling matrices based on a non-Hermitian generalization of the Ehrenfest theorem.","Mode coupling theory; Nonlinear waveguide couplers; Optical waveguide couplers; Photonic integrated circuits; PT-symmetric dimer","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990039907"

For digital mammography, objective quality assessment must be performed without references. In a previous study, the authors investigated the use of a normalized anisotropic quality index (NAQI) to assess mammography images blindly in terms of noise and spatial resolution. Since the NAQI is used as a quality metric, it must not be highly dependent on the breast anatomy. Thus, in this work, we analyze the NAQI behavior with different breast anatomies. A computerized system was used to synthesize 2,880 anthropomorphic breast phantom images with a realistic range of anatomical variations. The results show that NAQI is only marginally dependent on breast anatomy when images are acquired without degradation (<12%). However, for realizations that simulate the acquisition process in digital mammography, the NAQI is more sensitive (33%) to variations arising from quantum noise. Thus, NAQI can be used in clinical practice to assess mammographic image quality. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Anisotropy; Breast anatomy; Digital mammography; Image quality index","Anisotropy; Mammography; Medical imaging; Quality assurance; Quantum noise; Anatomical variations; Anthropomorphic breast phantom; Breast anatomy; Computerized systems; Digital mammography; Image quality index; Mammographic image quality; Objective quality assessment; Image quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977589993"

In the present work, the EET rates in five BODIPY-based EET cassettes in which anthracene serves as the donor have been determined, employing the monomer transition density approach (MTD) and the ideal dipole approximation (IDA). To this end, a new computer program has been devised that calculates the direct and exchange contributions to the excitonic coupling (EC) matrix element from transition density matrices generated by a combined density functional and multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) calculation for the monomers. EET rates have been calculated according to Fermis Golden Rule from the EC and the spectral overlap, which was obtained from the calculated vibrationally resolved emission and absorption spectra of donor and acceptor, respectively. We find that the direct contribution to the EC matrix element is dominant in the studied EET cassettes. Furthermore, we show that the contribution of the molecular linker to the EET rate cannot be neglected. In our best fragment model, the molecular linker is attached to the donor moiety. For cassettes in which the transition dipole moments of donor and acceptor are oriented in parallel manner, our results confirm the experimental findings reported by Kim et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 2006, 110, 20-27]. In cassettes with a perpendicular orientation of the donor and acceptor transition dipole moments, dynamic effects turn out to be important. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941089724"

We propose a projected gradient method for solving such problems. By exploiting the geometry of the feasible set, which is the intersection of the cone of Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices with the hyperplane defined by the unit trace constraint, we describe an efficient procedure to compute the projection onto this set using the Frobenius norm.

The results show our model conserves up to 51.8% of the energy required by a cluster designed for peak workload scenario, with a negligible impact on the applications performance. © 2015 IEEE.","Power-aware computing; Resource management; Scalability; Virtualization; Web server clusters","Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Dynamic frequency scaling; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Natural resources management; Network security; Power management; Resource allocation; Scalability; Virtual machine; Virtualization; Voltage scaling; Web services; Cluster-based Web server; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Power consumption reduction; Resource management; Scalable model; State-of-the-art approach; Virtual application; Web server cluster; Green computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964814496"

The new CCDs have superior quantum efficiency (QE) at wavelengths longer than 680nm, with significant sensitivity extending beyond 1 micron. Furthermore, the fringing level in GMOS-S data is now much lower due to the much thicker CCDs, additionally improving delivered sensitivity above that afforded by quantum efficiency alone. Soon after the Hamamatsu CCDs were installed in June 2014, some issues were noticed that impacted the ability to execute some science programs. In October 2015 the ARC controller electronics were upgraded and a cable was replaced, and since November 2015 GMOS-S has again been taking science data with the Hamamatsu detectors with no sign of the previous limitations.

As a consequence, the design of digital circuits using the majority-based logic has also been considered. Existing works essentially proposed different cell libraries to be applied in logic synthesis. However, the comparison between different approaches may not be straightforward since distinct circuit synthesis methodologies may be exploited. In order to allow a fair comparison of methodologies of generating quantum cellular automata (QCA) cell libraries and for performing QCA circuit synthesis is presented. The proposed library generation methodology is generic enough so that different basic logic functions can be considered. In addition to previous considered libraries, this work also considers a library comprising all 3-input functions implemented using both majority and AND-OR-Inverter gates. Experimental results compare different QCA libraries, showing that considering different basic gates leads to an average area reduction of up to 47%. © 2014 IEEE.","Cell library; Functional composition; Logic synthesis; Majority gate; Nanodevices; QCA; Quantum cellular automata","Cellular automata; Libraries; Logic Synthesis; Majority logic; Robots; Cell library; Functional compositions; Majority gates; Nano-devices; Quantum Cellular automata; Computer circuits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919494286"

Gal. Milton Tavares de Souza s/n, Gragoatá, Niterói, 24210–340, RJ, Brazil","In the one-way quantum computing model, the information processing is driven by measurements performed on an entangled state, called the resource state. In order to achieve parallelism, one aims to increase the number of simultaneous measurements, such that the effects of decoherence on the resource state are minimised due to the reduction of the time required to run the computation. At the heart of this question is the notion of quantum information flow, which specifies the dependency relations between the measurements in the computations. There exist two well-known techniques for reducing the time required to perform a one-way quantum computation without changing its semantics. The first one, called signal-shifting, transforms the flow of a graph (representing the resource state) within the measurement calculus formalism, whereas the second one, namely finding the maximallydelayed generalised flow, explores the geometry of the graph to increase the number of operations that can be performed simultaneously. In this paper, we show for the first time how these two techniques relate to each other. We prove that the application of the signal-shifting rules to a measurement pattern with flow results in a generalised flow for the pattern. Then, we prove that in the particular case when the input size equals the output size, the gflow obtained using signal-shifting has the lowest possible depth. As a side result, we construct an O(n3)-algorithm for finding maximally delayed gflows on graphs with flow. For those graphs, our algorithm is more efficient than the best previously known algorithm for the same task, which takes O(n4) operations to complete. © Rinton Press.","Flow and determinism; Measurement-based computing; Parallelism","Calculations; Graph algorithms; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Semantics; Flow and determinism; Measurement patterns; Measurement-based; Of quantum-information; One-way quantum computation; Parallelism; Quantum computing models; Simultaneous measurement; Signal flow graphs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928624417"

Although quite accurate hybrid quantum (DFT based)-classical methods are available, achieving statistically accurate and well converged results at a moderate computational cost is still an open challenge. Here, we present and thoroughly test a hybrid differential relaxation algorithm (HyDRA), which allows faster equilibration of the classical environment during the nonequilibrium steering of a (bio)chemical reaction. We show and discuss why (in the context of Jarzynski;s Relationship) this method allows obtaining accurate free energy profiles with smaller number of independent trajectories and/or faster pulling speeds, thus reducing the overall computational cost.

We aligned these parameters with the ones used in the hash-based signature schemes LDWM and XMSS. We report the performance results of our implementation on a modern Intel Core i7 3.4 GHz. In particular, a signing operation in the XMSS scheme can be computed in 2,001,479 cycles (1,694 signatures per second) at the 128-bit security level (against quantum attacks) using the SHA2-256 hash function, a tree of height 60 and 6 layers.

Several of the current challenges toward the progress of QCA technology is related to the automation of the design process and integration into existing design flows. In this regard, this paper proposes the universal, scalable, efficient (USE), and easily manufacturable clocking scheme. It solves one of the most limiting factors of existing clock schemes, the implementation of feedback paths and easy routing of QCA-based circuits. Consequently, USE facilitates considerably the development of standard cell libraries and design tools for this technology, besides avoiding thermodynamics problems. Case studies presented in this paper reveal an area reduction of up to factor 5 and delay decrease by up to factor 3 in comparison with an existing advanced clocking scheme. © 2015 IEEE.","Clock Generator; Clock Zones; Feedback and Routing; Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata,","Clocks; CMOS integrated circuits; Low power electronics; Nanocrystals; Reconfigurable hardware; Semiconductor quantum dots; Thermodynamics; Clock generator; Clock zones; Clocking schemes; Design process; Emerging technologies; Integration density; Low-power characteristics; Quantum dot cellular automata; Cellular automata","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963795576"

Specifically the Cohesive Homotopy Type Theory provides a formal, logical approach to concepts like smoothness, cohomology and Khovanov homology; and such approach permits to clarify the quantum algorithms in the context of Topological and Geometrical Quantum Computation. In particular we consider the so-called a ""open-closed stringy topological quantum computera"" which is a theoretical topological quantum computer that employs a system of open-closed strings whose worldsheets are open-closed cobordisms. The open-closed stringy topological computer is able to compute the Khovanov homology for tangles and for hence it is a universal quantum computer given than any quantum computation is reduced to an instance of computation of the Khovanov homology for tangles. The universal algebra in this case is the Frobenius Algebra and the possible open-closed stringy topological quantum computers are forming a symmetric monoidal category which is equivalent to the category of knowledgeable Frobenius algebras. Then the mathematical design of an open-closed stringy topological quantum computer is involved with computations and theorem proving for generalized Frobenius algebras. Such computations and theorem proving can be performed automatically using the Automated Theorem Provers with the TPTP language and the SMT-solver Z3 with the SMT-LIB language. Some examples of application of ATPs and SMT-solvers in the mathematical setup of an open-closed stringy topological quantum computer will be provided. © 2015 SPIE.","Automated Theorem Proving; Frobenius Algebras; Geometrical Quantum Computation; Khovanov Homotopy; Khovanov Homotopy Type Theory; Supersymmetry; Topological Quantum Computation","Algebra; Computational linguistics; Formal languages; Geometry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Supersymmetry; Theorem proving; Topology; Automated theorem prover; Automated theorem proving; Homotopies; Homotopy types; Logical approaches; Mathematical designs; Monoidal categories; Quantum algorithms; Computation theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938704249"

Communication systems are important in current computer systems and it is expected to be even more important in near future. Although QCA has been widely studied in the development of logic circuits, there are few studies applying this promising technology to the design of communication systems. In a bottom-up approach, we describe the parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel converters, which are essential to the serial communication. We also propose and present components for robust communication, such as QCA circuits for Hamming code and parity checker. We demonstrate the functionality, test and validate the proposed architectures using QCADesigner simulator.

Their structures and energetics have been investigated at the density functional level of theory, up to B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), incorporating solvent effects with polarizable continuum models. In addition, their potential antioxidant activities were probed through the computation of the (i) bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs), which are related to the hydrogen-atom transfer mechanism (HAT), and (ii) ionization potentials (IPs), which are related to the single-electron transfer mechanism (SET). The BDEs were determined in water to be 83.23 kcal/mol for kaempferol 3-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnoside and 77.49 kcal/mol for quercetin 3-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnoside.

In this paper we study the energy efficiency of a class of Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms for a given integral equation using hybrid HPC systems. The algorithms are applied to solve quantum kinetic integral equations describing ultra-fast transport in quantum wire. We compare the energy performance of the algorithms using a GPU-based computer platform and CPU-based computer platform both with and without hyper-threading (HT) technology. We use SPRNG library and CURAND generator to produce parallel pseudo-random (PPR) sequences for the MC algorithms on CPU-based and GPU-based platforms, respectively. For our QMC algorithms Sobol and Halton sequences are used to produce parallel quasi-random (PQR) sequences. We compare the obtained results of the tested algorithms with respect to the given energy metric.

First, we present efficient simulations of probabilistic and quantum automata by means of affine automata which allows us to characterize the class of exclusive stochastic languages. Then, we initiate a study on the succintness of affine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary regular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata, whereas the number of states of any quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded. Finally, we present the characterization of all (regular) unary languages recognized by two-state affine automata. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Affine automata; Bounded-error; One-sided error; Probabilistic automata; Quantum automata; State complexity; Stochastic language","Computational linguistics; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Probabilistic logics; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Affine automata; Bounded errors; Probabilistic automata; Quantum automata; State complexity; Stochastic language; Automata theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977522764"

A first part discusses conceptual tools, which can be later useful for general mathematical practice or as computational quantum similarity indices. After preliminary definitions, two elements, which can be associated with arbitrary sets of a vector space, are described: the centroid and the variance vectors. The Minkowski norm of the variance vector is shown to comply with the axioms of a collective distance. The role of the Gram matrix, associated with a vector set, is linked to the definition of numerical variance. Several simple application examples involving linear algebra and N-dimensional geometry are given. In a second part, all previous definitions are applied to quantum multimolecular polyhedra (QMP), where a set of molecular quantum mechanical density functions act as vertices. The numerical Minkowski norm of the variance vector in any QMP could be considered as a superposition of molecular contributions, corresponding to a new set of quantum similarity indices, which can generate intrinsic ordering among QMP vertices. In this way, the role of quantum similarity matrix elements is evidenced. Application to collections of molecular structures is analyzed as an illustrative practical exercise. The connection of the QMP framework with classical and quantum quantitative structure-properties relation (QSPR) becomes evident with the aid of numerical examples computed over several molecular sets acting as QMP. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","Geometry; Matrix algebra; Quantum theory; Vectors; Application examples; Arbitrary sets; Arbitrary vectors; Molecular contribution; Notion of distance; Quantitative structures; Quantum mechanical; Quantum similarity; Vector spaces","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940020583"

This staggering diversity and the need to better understand it led inevitably to the development of classification schemes called biological taxonomies. Unfortunately, in addition to this enormous diversity, the traditional identification and classification workflows are both slow and error-prone; classification expertise is in the hands of a small number of expert taxonomists; and to make things worse, the number of taxonomists has steadily declined in recent years. Automated identification of organisms has therefore become not just a long time desire but a need to better understand, use, and save biodiversity. This paper presents a survey of recent efforts to use computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify organisms. It focuses on the use of leaf images to identify plant species.

QCA has been considered as an alternative for field-effect transistors due to its quite small size (nanometers), ultra-low power consumption and clock rate (terahertz range). On the other hand, reversible computation is a new paradigm where all logic operations can be performed in an invertible way. This feature is important to different technologies, such as quantum computing, adiabatic circuits, low power computation, etc. Regarding low power consumption, QCA has been seen as a promising technology for approaching the thermodynamic limit of computation and this work focus on designing a QCA reversible ALU in order to go beyond that limit, bridging the gap between QCA technology and reversible components. In a bottom-up approach, we first discuss QCA reversible gates and a few design choices. We also present the ALU's QCA design, demonstrate the functionality, test and validate the proposed architecture using QCADesigner simulator.

More general computational models over the same field such as generalized finite automata (GFAs) and quantum finite automata (QFAs) define the same class. In 1963, Rabin proved the set of stochastic languages to be uncountable presenting a single 2-state PFA over the binary alphabet recognizing uncountably many languages depending on the cutpoint. In this paper, we show the same result for unary stochastic languages. Namely, we exhibit a 2-state unary GFA, a 2-state unary QFA, and a family of 3-state unary PFAs recognizing uncountably many languages; all these numbers of states are optimal. After this, we completely characterize the class of languages recognized by 1-state GFAs, which is the only nontrivial class of languages recognized by 1-state automata. Finally, we consider the variations of PFAs, QFAs, and GFAs based on the notion of inclusive/exclusive cutpoint, and present some results on their expressive power. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Context-free languages; Generalized finite automata; Probabilistic finite automata; Quantum finite automata; Regular languages; Stochastic languages; Unary languages","Computational linguistics; Finite automata; Formal languages; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Binary alphabets; Computational model; Expressive power; Generalized finite automaton; Probabilistic finite automata; Quantum finite automata; Real number; Unary languages; Article; computer language; generalized finite automata; mathematical analysis; probabilistic finite automata; pseudo stochastic language; quantum finite automata; quantum language; statistical parameters; stochastic language; Context free languages","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959127919"

This phenomenon, reflected in Friedel's law, permits to relate the quantum phase shifts with both the density of states at the Fermi level and the transport properties of the system. This work calculates the electric resistivity of nanometric clusters in an aluminiumsupercell, emulating the formation of Guinier-Preston zones during pre-precipitation in an Al-Zn alloy. The density of states is evaluated each time a new atom of solute is added to the Al supercell using the ab initio method of the Density Functional Theory or DFT in its GGA and LDA approximations via the Dmol3 package of Materials Studio Software. A resistivity anomaly is obtained when, in concordance with literature reports for diluted AlZn alloys, the supercell contains 25 atoms, thus confirming that the electric resistivity anomaly during cluster formation is a consequence of both density of states variations and quantum transitions at the Fermi Level for a nanometric size in particular.

Like QIEA, GQIEA is also based on the quantum computing principle of superposition of states, but extending it not only to be used for binary values {0, 1}, but for any finite set of values {1,⋯, n}. GQIEA, as any other quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm, defines an own quantum individual, an evaluation function and population operators. As in QIEA, GQIEA also defines a generalized Q-gate operator, which is a variation operator to drive the individuals toward better solutions. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability, the proposal will be applied to the Knapsack Problem (KP), a classic combinatorial optimization problem. Results show that GQIEA has a good performance even with a small population. © 2015 IEEE.","Evolutionary Computation; Knap-sack problem; Quantum-Inspired Algorithms","Combinatorial optimization; Optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Combinatorial optimization problems; Evaluation function; Knap-sack problem; Knapsack problems; Principle of superposition; Quantum Computing; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Variation operator; Evolutionary algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011891484"

We construct a concrete denotational semantics of Selinger and Valiron's quantum lambda calculus, which was previously an open problem.

The main technical ingredients are Day's convolution theory and Kelly and Freyd's notion of continuity of functors. We first give an abstract description of the properties required of the base categories for the model construction to work. We then exhibit a specific example of base categories satisfying these properties. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Computation theory; Differentiation (calculus); Categorical model; Denotational semantics; First-order; Higher-order; Lambda calculus; Model construction; Models of quantum computations; Presheaves; Quantum computers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893474866"

They have been considered for quantum information transfer between subunits of a quantum information processing device at short or intermediate distances. The most frequently studied task is the transfer of a single-qubit state. Several protocols have been developed to achieve this goal, broadly divisible into two classes, fully-engineered and boundarycontrolled spin chains. We discuss state transfer induced by the natural dynamics of these two classes of systems, and the influence of deviations from the ideal system configuration, that is, manufacturing errors in the nearest-neighbor spin couplings. The fidelity of state transfer depends on the chain length and the disorder strength. We observe a power-law scaling of the fidelity deficit, i.e. the deviation from perfect transfer. Boundary-controlled chains can provide excellent fidelity under suitable circumstances and are potentially less difficult to manufacture and control than fully-engineered chains.We also review other existing theoretical work on the robustness of quantum state transfer as well as proposals for experimental implementation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","","Chains; Manufacture; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Linear arrangements; Manufacturing errors; Power law scalings; Quantum information processing devices; Quantum information transfer; Quantum state transfers; Several protocols; Single-qubit state; Spin dynamics","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011395806"

The method associates the problem of finding the optimal entanglement witness of a state with a class of problems known as semidefinite programs, which can be solved efficiently with arbitrary accuracy. Based on these optimal witnesses, we introduce a measure of quantum correlations which has an interpretation analogous to the Generalized Robustness of entanglement. We also extend the notion of quantum discord to the case of indistinguishable fermions, and propose a geometric quantifier, which is compared to our entanglement measure. Our numerical results show a remarkable equivalence between the proposed Generalized Robustness and the Schliemann concurrence, which are equal for pure states. For mixed states, the Schliemann concurrence presents itself as an upper bound for the Generalized Robustness. The quantum discord is also found to be an upper bound for the entanglement. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Extended Hubbard model; Generalized robustness; Indistinguishable fermions; Quantum correlations; Quantum discord; Quantum-phase transitions; Schliemann concurrence; Witness operators","Phase transitions; Extended Hubbard model; Quantum correlations; Quantum discords; Quantum phase transitions; Schliemann concurrence; Witness operators; Quantum entanglement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878600463"

Molecular gradients and Hessians are available for geometry optimizations, molecular dynamics, and vibrational studies, whereas magnetic resonance and optical activity can be studied in a gauge-origin-invariant manner. Frequency-dependent molecular properties can be calculated using linear, quadratic, and cubic response theory. A large number of singlet and triplet perturbation operators are available for the study of one-, two-, and three-photon processes. Environmental effects may be included using various dielectric-medium and quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics models.

Such filters are gaussians multiplied by Hermite polynomials and for this reason they will be called Gaussian-Hermite filters. These new quantum filters can be used as smoothing filters and they show good performance when elimination of noise is concerned. Besides of this the new quantum filters can be used to define blurred derivatives and blurred Laplacians for images and in this case the quantum filters are excellent edge detectors. Finally the quantum filters and their derivatives are used to define quantum curvature filters as the Ricci-scalar-curvature filter and the Gaussian-curvature filter. In this last case the quantum filters perform well as curvature detectors and contrast enhancement operators. Our experimental results show that the quantum filters are more efficient than the classical filters and we claim that the quantum image processing will be a very important trend in the near future sensing technology. © 2013 SPIE.","Computer algebra; Computer vision; Hermite functions; Image processing; Quantum filters; Two-dimensional quantum oscillator","Computer vision; Gaussian distribution; Image processing; Quantum optics; Two dimensional; Blurred derivatives; Computer algebra; Contrast Enhancement; Hermite functions; Hermite polynomials; Quantum filters; Quantum image processing; Quantum oscillators; Polynomials","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881181340"

QCA technology consists of a group of cells which, when combined and arranged in a particular way, are able to perform computational functions. QCA technology transfers information by means of the polarization state of various cells in contrast to traditional computers, which use the flow of electrical current to transfer information. We propose an area efficient 4×1 multiplex-based Configurable Logic Block (CLB). We also propose a novel routing technique that is able to connect CLBs located at three different range groups.

This drug delivery system allows the release of an encapsulated cytotoxic cocktail in a controlled manner under pulsed radio frequency (RF) irradiation. Our effort is focused on the computational aided design of a high affinity bispecific anti-HER2 antibody and an opening mechanism of the carbon nanotube (CNT) based cytotoxic carrier for controlling multiple drug release. We study the main interactions between the antibody and the antigen by a computational scanning mutagenesis approach of trastuzumab and pertuzumab fragment antigen binding (Fab) structures in order to enhance their binding affinity. Then, each Fab fragments is joined by a polypeptide linker which should be stable enough to avoid the ""open form"" of antibody. On the other hand, we also conjugate the engineered antibody to functionalized CNTs (f-CNTs), which encapsulate the inhibitors of the HER2/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. We take advantage of the fact that f-CNT converts the RF radiation absorption into heat release. A pulsed laser at 13.45 MHz increments the temperature around 40 C for triggering the nano-caps destabilization, which allows the switching of the opening mechanism of the drug carrier. Nano-caps will be a dual pH/temperature responsive in order to take advantage of lysosome characteristic (acidic pH) and heat release from the carrier. Nano-caps are functionalized with organic amide moieties, which hydrolyze quickly at an acidic pH into primary amines, and protonated amines generate repulsion interactions with other charged species, which trigger the cytotoxics release.

Here is a summary of our results: 1 There is a promise problem solvable by an exact two-way QFA in exponential expected time, but not by any bounded-error sublogarithmic space probabilistic Turing machines. 2 There is a promise problem solvable by a Las Vegas realtime QFA, but not by any bounded-error realtime PFA. The same problem can be solvable by an exact two-way QFA in linear expected time but not by any exact two-way PFA. 3 There is a family of promise problems such that each promise problem can be solvable by a two-state exact realtime QFAs, but, there is no such bound on the number of states of realtime bounded-error PFAs solving the members of this family. Our results imply that there exist zero-error quantum computational devices with a single qubit of memory that cannot be simulated by any finite memory classical computational model. This provides a computational perspective on results regarding ontological theories of quantum mechanics [20,28]. As a consequence we find that classical automata based simulation models [24,6] are not sufficiently powerful to simulate quantum contextuality. We conclude by highlighting the interplay between results from automata models and their application to developing a general framework for quantum contextuality. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","Computer simulation; Finite automata; Quantum theory; Turing machines; Computational devices; Computational model; Ontological theories; Probabilistic finite automata; Promise problems; Quantum automata; Quantum finite automata; Sublogarithmic spaces; Problem solving","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958540401"

In this paper, we focus on classical automata and obtain some new results regarding the succinctness of models and their computational powers. We start with a negative result. Recently, Ambainis and YakaryIlmaz (2012) introduced a quantumly very cheap family of unary promise problems, i.e. solvable exactly by using only a single qubit. We show that two-way nondeterminism does not have any advantage over realtime determinism for this family of promise problems. Secondly, we present some basic facts for classical models: The computational powers of deterministic, nondeterministic, alternating, and Las Vegas probabilistic automata are the same. Then, we show that any gap of succinctness between any two of deterministic, nondeterministic, and alternating automata models for language recognition cannot be violated on promise problems. On the other hand, we show that the tight quadratic gap between Las Vegas realtime probabilistic automata and realtime deterministic automata given for language recognition can be replaced with a tight exponential gap on promise problems. Lastly, we show how the situation can be different when considering two-sided bounded-error. Similar to quantum case, we present a probabilistically very cheap family of unary promise problems, i.e. solvable by a 2-state automaton with bounded-error. Then, we show that this family is not cheap for any of the aforementioned classical models. Moreover, we show that bounded-error probabilistic automata are more powerful than any other classical model on promise problems. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","","Automata theory; Dispersion compensation; Quantum theory; Alternating automata; Classical model; Deterministic automata; Language recognition; Non-determinism; Probabilistic automata; Promise problems; Quantum automata; Problem solving","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905391051"

By performing this operation, the system can evaluate all possibilities in only one step by making a parallel computation; meanwhile, in the classic way, this evaluation is carried out independently of each other, and in different steps. The quantum parallelism can be defined as a reduction in time and an increase in the fast of information process.

Thus, plant operators have to identify an event based upon the evaluation of several distinct process variables, which might difficult operators' actions and decisions. Transient identification systems have been proposed in order to support the analysis with the aim of achieving successful or effective courses of action, as well as to reduce the time interval for a decision and corrective actions. This paper presents a transient diagnosis system for PWR (pressurized water reactor) NPP whose optimization step of the classification algorithm is based upon the paradigm of the Quantum Computing. In this case, the optimization metaheuristic Quantum Delta Potential Swarm Optimization (QDSO) was implemented and tested. The system is able to identify anomalous events related to transients of the time series of process variables related to normal condition and three design-basis accidents. Unlike the Diagnosis System proposed in the literature, Minkowski distance was employed to calculate the similarity distance.","Minkowski distance and nuclear accident identification problem; Particle swarm optimization; Quantum delta-potential well based particle swarm optimization algorithm","Accidents; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Nuclear power plants; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quantum computers; Transients; Classification algorithm; Corrective actions; Minkowski distance; Nuclear accidents; Optimization metaheuristic; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Similarity distance; Transient identification; Pressurized water reactors","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902347457"

Although there are many existing alternative measures for quantifying the structural properties of undirected graphs, there are relatively few corresponding measures for directed graphs. To fill this gap in the literature, we explore a number of alternative techniques that are applicable to directed graphs. We commence by using Chung's generalisation of the Laplacian of a directed graph to extend the computation of von Neumann entropy from undirected to directed graphs. We provide a simplified form of the entropy which can be expressed in terms of simple vertex in-degree and out-degree statistics. Moreover, we find approximate forms of the von Neumann entropy that apply to both weakly and strongly directed graphs, and that can be used to characterize network structure. Next we explore how to extend Estrada's heterogeneity index from undirected to directed graphs. Our measure is motivated by the simplified von Neumann entropy, and involves measuring the heterogeneity of differences in in-degrees and out-degrees. Finally, we perform an analysis which reveals a novel linear relationship between heterogeneity and resistance distance (commute time) statistics for undirected graphs. This means that the larger the difference between the average commute time and shortest return path length between pairs of vertices, the greater the heterogeneity index. Based on this observation together with the definition of commute time on a directed graph, we define an analogous heterogeneity measure for directed graphs. We illustrate the usefulness of the measures defined in this paper for datasets describing Erdos-Renyi, 'small-world', 'scale-free' graphs, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and evolving networks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","directed graph; heterogeneity index; structural complexity; von Neumann entropy","Complex networks; Entropy; Pattern recognition; Proteins; Quantum theory; Corresponding measures; Estrada's heterogeneity indices; Heterogeneity index; Linear relationships; Protein-protein interaction networks; Resistance distance; Structural complexity; Von Neumann entropy; Directed graphs","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879860138"

The application calculates 2D regular grids (electron densities and its laplacians) in a plane positioned by the user. By using bicubic interpolation and the Newton-Raphson method, the critical points at the plane can be calculated, and the gradient field and molecular graph can also be generated using the Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta method. It also permits plotting the electron density and its negative laplacian on the selected plane. Moreover, for both 2D grids, it is possible to calculate the contour maps using the ""Marching Squares"" algorithm. This application also permits finding the critical points in the 3D space. The output consist of plain text files and images in PNG, BMP and EPS (encapsulated post script) formats.

Therefore, inhibiting CatB may be a way to control unregulated cellular functions and prevent tissue malformations. The inhibitory action of 1,2,4-thiadiazole (TDZ) derivatives has been associated in the literature with their ability to form disulfide bridges with the catalytic cysteine of CatB. In this work, we present molecular modeling and docking studies of a series of eight 1,2,4-thiadiazole compounds. Substitutions at two positions (3 and 5) on the 1,2,4-thiadiazole ring were analyzed, and the docking scores were correlated to experimental data. A correlation was found with the sequence of scores of four related compounds with different substituents at position 5. No correlation was observed for changes at position 3. In addition, quantum chemistry calculations were performed on smaller molecular models to study the mechanism of inhibition of TDZ at the active site of CatB. All possible protonation states of the ligand and the active site residues were assessed. The tautomeric form in which the proton is located on N2 was identified as the species that has the structural and energetic characteristics that would allow the ring opening of 1,2,4-thiadiazole. © Springer-Verlag 2014.","Cysteine protease cathepsin thiadiazole docking; Quantum chemistry","Binding Sites; Cathepsin B; Computer-Aided Design; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Drug Design; Isomerism; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Structure; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Quantum Theory; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thiadiazoles; 1,2,4 thiadiazole derivative; cathepsin B; cathepsin B inhibitor; proton; cathepsin B; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; ligand; protein binding; thiadiazole derivative; article; drug mechanism; energy transfer; enzyme inhibition; enzyme inhibitor interaction; ligand binding; molecular docking; molecular model; priority journal; proton transport; quantum chemistry; structure activity relation; theoretical study; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; computer aided design; drug design; isomerism; metabolism; molecular docking; protein conformation; quantum theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901579287"

Trabalhador São-Carlense, 400, Brazil","A new restoration methodology is proposed to enhance mammographic images through the improvement of contrast features and the simultaneous suppression of noise. Denoising is performed in the first step using the Anscombe transformation to convert the signal-dependent quantum noise into an approximately signal-independent Gaussian additive noise. In the Anscombe domain, noise is filtered through an adaptive Wiener filter, whose parameters are obtained by considering local image statistics. In the second step, a filter based on the modulation transfer function of the imaging system in the whole radiation field is applied for image enhancement. This methodology can be used as a preprocessing module for computer-aided detection (CAD) systems to improve the performance of breast cancer screening.A preliminary assessment of the restoration algorithm was performed using synthetic images with different levels of quantum noise. Afterward, we evaluated the effect of the preprocessing on the performance of a previously developed CAD system for clustered microcalcification detection in mammographic images. The results from the synthetic images showed an increase of up to 11.5 dB (p0 0.002) in the peak signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the mean structural similarity index increased up to 8.3 % (p<0.001). Regarding CAD performance, the results suggested that the preprocessing increased the detectability of microcalcifications in mammographic images without increasing the false-positive rates. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an average increase of 14.1 % (p00.01) in overall CAD performance when restored image sets were used. © Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine 2012.","Anscombe transformation; Computer-aided detection (CAD); Image denoising; Mammography; Modulation transfer function; Quantum noise; Wiener filter","Artifacts; Breast Diseases; Female; Humans; Mammography; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Calcification (biochemistry); Computer aided diagnosis; Image denoising; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Modulation; Optical transfer function; Quantum noise; Restoration; X ray screens; Anscombe transformation; Clustered microcalcification detections; Computer-aided detection; Gaussian additive noise; Mean structural similarity indices; Peak signal-to-noise ratio; Receiver operating characteristic analysis; WIENER filters; article; artifact; breast disease; computer assisted diagnosis; equipment; female; human; image quality; mammography; methodology; radiography; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; Mammography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884293967"

The main contribution of this paper is to show that quantum computing can be used to extend the class of fuzzy sets. The central idea associates the states of a quantum register to membership functions (mFs) of fuzzy subsets, and the rules for the processes of fuzzyfication are performed by unitary quantum transformations. Thus, this paper describes multi-dimensional quantum registers, associated to mFs on the unitary interval U, in order to introduce a novel interpretation of aggregations found in fuzzy set theory. In particular, t-norms and t-conorms based on quantum gates allows the modeling and interpretation of union, intersection, difference and implication among fuzzy sets, also including an expression for the class of fuzzy S-implications. Furthermore, an interpretation of the symmetric sum was achieved by considering the quantum register sum operator. © 2013 IEEE.","Aggregation operations; Fuzzy logic; Quantum computing; Quantum operators","Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Mathematical operators; Quantum electronics; Aggregation operation; Fuzzyfication; Novel interpretation; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Quantum operators; Quantum register; Quantum transformation; Quantum computers","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887846458"

Such feature is achieved due the presence of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) that provides a great charge density on nearby region from its tips. Considerable studies have described theoretical and experimentally the influence of gap between tips on radiation emission, once this parameter may improve the local field, as such length decrease. In optical regime, the emission enhancement is due the quantum-plasmonic interaction created from tips region (localized field) and the transition levels from rare earth ion of erbium (Er3+) and thulium (Tm3+). However, metallic nanobowtie with absence of gap still deserve attention, because in addition to present similar properties from regular case as previously mentioned, can also interacts with different systems, like gain materials, that can be embedded thermically into the substrate. Rare earth ion is one of the remarkable and suitable for our proposition, not only for the enhancement on measured intensity, but also its easiness to implement it on glasses, which constitute the main type of substrate adopted on plasmonic structures. In this work we performed the analysis of effects due implementation of Er3+ and Tm3+ ions into BK7 glass over a pattern of nanobowtie on absence of gap between its tips, fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) technique from gold (Au) films. The bowties were vertically excited by an Argon laser (Ar) which wavelength is 488 nm. Furthermore, computational simulations based on finite element method (FEM), were performed to verify the dependence of nanobowtieas geometry over the electric field along its symmetry axis. © 2013 SPIE.","localized surface plasmon resonance; Metallic nanobowtie; quantum plasmonic interaction; rare earth ion","Computational geometry; Electric fields; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Embedded systems; Glass; Gold; Metal ions; Nanostructures; Optical communication; Optical properties; Plasmons; Surface plasmon resonance; Tellurium compounds; Thulium; Computational simulation; Emission enhancement; Focused ion beam technique; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Metallic nanobowtie; Plasmonic interactions; Rare earth ions; Surface plasmon polaritons; Erbium","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899964356"

This ability has originated the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which are classical algorithms (for classical computers) that exploit quantum mechanics principles to improve their performance. Several proposed QIEAs are able to outperform their traditional counterparts when applied to different kinds of problems. Aiming to exploit this new paradigm on genetic programming (GP), this paper introduces a novel QIEA model (quantum-inspired linear GP-QuaLiGP), which evolves machine code programs. QuaLiGP is inspired on multi-level quantum systems, and its operation is based on quantum individuals, which represent a superposition of all programs (solutions) of the search space. The tests use symbolic regression and binary classification as knowledge management problems to assess the QuaLiGP performance and compare it with Automatic Induction of Machine Code by Genetic Programming model, which is currently the most efficient GP model to evolve machine code. Results show that QuaLiGP outperforms the reference GP system for all these problems, by achieving better solutions from a smaller number of evaluations and by using fewer parameters and operators. This paper concludes that the quantum-inspired paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs efficiently, encouraging improvements and extensions of QuaLiGP. © 2013 The Author.","binary classification; evolutionary computation; genetic programming; quantum-inspired algorithms; symbolic regression","Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Automatic induction; Binary classification; Genetic programming modeling; Knowledge management system; Linear genetic programming; Machine code programs; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Symbolic regression; Genetic programming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883377598"

We first present a brief motivation, and a basic scheme to illustrate the idea of quantum state transfer through a spin chain. This is followed by an outline survey (by no means exhaustive) of the progress to date. We then describe one of the recently proposed methods which provides a high fidelity state transfer with minimal engineering, encoding and control. Next we present a couple of protocols for using nonequilibrium dynamics induced by quenches for establishing entanglement between well separated spins - these use the natural entanglement in a canonical condensed matter system, namely the Kondo system, but convert it to a useful form through the dynamics. Finally the possibility of usage of spin chains for quantum logic between remote registers is discussed along with a specific application to atomic systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","","Chains; Computer circuits; Condensed matter physics; Dynamics; Quantum optics; Condensed matter system; High-fidelity; Non-equilibrium dynamics; Quantum logic; Quantum state transfers; Remote registers; Scalable quantum information; State transfer; Spin dynamics","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907923432"

The double effect calculus comprises a quantum arrow layer defined over a quantum monadic layer. In previous works we have developed the quantum arrow calculus, a calculus where we can consider just impure (or mixed) quantum computations. Technically, here we extend the quantum arrow calculus with a construct (and equations) that allows the communication of the monadic layer with the arrow layer of the calculus. That is, the quantum arrow is defined over a monadic instance enabling to consider pure and impure quantum computations in the same framework. As a practical contribution, the calculus allows to express quantum algorithms including reversible operations over pure states and measurements in the middle of the computation using a traditional style of functional programming and reasoning. We also define equations for algebraic reasoning of computations involving measurements. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","","Functional programming; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Algebraic reasoning; Double effects; Pure state; Quantum algorithms; Calculations","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887465384"

The data obtained are used to compare and contrast this deamination reaction with those of other cytosine derivatives. The deamination process for 5hmCyt is similar to the corresponding processes for other unsaturated derivatives in that the amino form is the reactive one and water addition is the rate-limiting step.

A Monte Carlo population-weighted average spectrum was produced based on the predicted Boltzmann contributions. In general, good agreement between experimental and theoretical data was obtained using both methods, and the 13C NMR chemical shifts were predicted highly accurately. The geometry was optimized at the semiempirical level and used to calculate the NMR chemical shifts at the DFT level, and these shifts showed only minor deviations from those obtained following structural optimization at the DFT level, and incurred a much lower computational cost.

Box 518, Sweden","Proton/hydrogen-transfer processes have been broadly studied in the past 50 years to explain the photostability and the spontaneous tautomerism in the DNA base pairs. In the present study, the CASSCF/CASPT2 methodology is used to map the two-dimensional potential energy surfaces along the stretched NH reaction coordinates of the guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair. Concerted and stepwise pathways are explored initially in vacuo, and three mechanisms are studied: the stepwise double proton transfer, the stepwise double hydrogen transfer, and the concerted double proton transfer. The results are consistent with previous findings related to the photostability of the GC base pair, and a new contribution to tautomerism is provided. The C-based imino-oxo and imino-enol GC tautomers, which can be generated during the UV irradiation of the Watson-Crick base pair, have analogous radiationless energy-decay channels to those of the canonical base pair. In addition, the C-based imino-enol GC tautomer is thermally less stable. A study of the GC base pair is carried out subsequently taking into account the DNA surroundings in the biological environment. The most important stationary points are computed using the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach, suggesting a similar scenario for the proton/hydrogen-transfer phenomena in vacuo and in DNA. Finally, the static model is complemented by ab initio dynamic simulations, which show that vibrations at the hydrogen bonds can indeed originate hydrogen-transfer processes in the GC base pair.

More general computational models over the same field such as generalized finite automata (GFAs) and quantum finite automata (QFAs) define the same class. In 1963, Rabin proved the set of stochastic languages to be uncountable presenting a single 2-state PFA over the binary alphabet recognizing uncountably many languages depending on the cutpoint. In this paper, we show the same result for unary stochastic languages. Namely, we exhibit a 2-state unary GFA, a 2-state unary QFA, and a family of 4-state unary PFAs recognizing uncountably many languages. After this, we completely characterize the class of languages recognized by 1-state GFAs, which is the only nontrivial class of languages recognized by 1-state automata. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","generalized finite automata; probabilistic finite automata; quantum finite automata; stochastic languages; unary languages","Finite automata; Quantum theory; Binary alphabets; Computational model; Cut-point; Generalized finite automaton; Probabilistic finite automata; Quantum finite automata; Real number; Unary languages; Stochastic systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958545509"

CISe films were grown based on a modified 3-stage co-evaporation process that enabled the oxidation of In2Se3 precursor layer at the end of the first stage. To study the role of grain boundaries on oxidation, precursor layers were prepared at high and low temperatures. In2Se3 precursor thin film grown at high temperature shows a gammaphase with (110) preferential orientation and grain size of 0.5-1 micrometer. Precursor layer prepared at low temperature showed amorphous structure with grains size around 300 nm. CISe films prepared with both precursor layers (high and low temperature) exhibit chalcopyrite structure with a (112) preferential orientation. Comparison between samples prepared with and without air-annealing do not exhibit clear morphological or structural changes. The effect of oxidation process on electrical properties of the solar cells was studied with current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements. These results showed that, as compared to devices with nonoxidized CISe, the device with 1h-oxidized CISe film exhibit a decrement in open circuit voltage of ~65mV. This could be related to passivation of interface states on the CdS/CISe interface. Comparing oxidized-CISe cells with different grain boundary density, more degradation of electrical parameters were observed on samples with high number of grain boundaries. Our result show that oxygen introduction to CISe films through the air-annealing of In2Se3 precursors is detrimental to the CISe based solar cell performance. © 2014 IEEE.","3-stage process; CuInSe<sub>2</sub>; Oxidation","Annealing; Automation; Cadmium sulfide; Copper compounds; Film preparation; Grain boundaries; Heterojunctions; II-VI semiconductors; Indium compounds; Interface states; Open circuit voltage; Oxidation; Process control; Selenium compounds; Temperature; Thin film solar cells; Thin films; Amorphous structures; Chalcopyrite structures; CuInSe2; External quantum efficiency; Grain boundary densities; Heterojunction solar cells; Preferential orientation; Solar cell performance; Iodine compounds","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938797885"

Particularly, examples of links with identical integral Khovanov homology but with distinct Khovanov homotopy types were showed. In the presente work we will introduce possible quantum algorithms for the Lipshitz-Sarkar-Steenrod square for Khovanov Homolog and their possible simulations using computer algebra. © 2013 SPIE.","D-branes; Khovanov Homology; Khovanov Homotopy; Lipshitz-Sarkar-Steenrod square; Quantum invariants; Topological Quantum Computation","Algebra; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Topology; D-branes; Homotopies; Khovanov Homology; Lipshitz-Sarkar-Steenrod square; Quantum invariants; Quantum theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881158547"

Among other important aspects, they represent a powerful way for synchronizing hardware components so that these components may cooperate adequately in the fulfillment of the main objective of the hardware design. In this chapter, we propose an evolutionary methodology based on the principles of quantum computing to synthesize finite state machines. First, we optimally solve the state assignment NP-complete problem, which is inherent to designing any synchronous finite state machines. This is motivated by the fact that with an optimal state assignment, one can physically implement the state machine in question using a minimal hardware area and response time. Second, with the optimal state assignment provided, we propose to use the same evolutionary methodology to yield an optimal evolutionary hardware that implements the state machine control component. The evolved hardware requires a minimal hardware area and imposes a minimal propagation delay on the machine output signals. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958538520"

The leading thread is the interplay between quantum biology (QB) and complexity. As the paper asks whether QB does contribute to complexity science (CS), five arguments are provided: (i) Firstly a state-of-the art of QB and its relationship to CS is sketched out. Thereafter, the attention is directed to answering the question set out; (ii) Secondly, it digs into the understanding of life toward deeper levels of reality; (iii) It is shown that non-trivial quantum effects shed insightful lights on the information processing of and within living beings; (iv) Once the distinction is made between increasing levels of complexity and increasing levels of organization, the focus lies in the importance of QB for organization, and not so much for complexity as such; (v) The role of information rises at the center of all concerns, and the intertwining of complexity and information processing.

In particular, the latter field has been object in the recent years of an increasing interest: the compactness and phase stability of integrated waveguide circuits are enabling experiments unconceivable with bulk-optics set-ups. Linear photonic devices for quantum information are based on quantum and classical interference effects: the desired circuit operation can be achieved only with tight fabrication control on both power repartition in splitting elements and phase retardance in the various paths. Here we report on a novel three-dimensional circuit architecture, made possible by the unique capabilities of femtosecond laser waveguide writing, which enables us to realize integrated multimode devices implementing arbitrary linear transformations. Networks of cascaded directional couplers can be built with independent control on the splitting ratios and the phase shifts in each branch. In detail, we show an arbitrarily designed 5×5 integrated interferometer: characterization with one- and two-photon experiments confirms the accuracy of our fabrication technique. We exploit the fabricated circuit to implement a small instance of the boson-sampling experiments with up to three photons, which is one of the most promising approaches to realize phenomena hard to simulate with classical computers. We will further show how, by studying classical and quantum interference in many random multimode circuits, we may gain deeper insight into the bosonic coalescence phenomenon. © 2014 SPIE.","Boson sampling; Femtosecond laser writing; Integrated optics; Quantum photonics","Bosons; Experiments; Fabrication; Industrial applications; Integrated optics; Interferometers; Logic gates; Photons; Quantum optics; Telecommunication networks; Ultrashort pulses; Coalescence phenomenon; Femtosecond laser writing; Integrated photonic circuit; Integrated waveguides; Multimode interferometer; Optical telecommunication networks; Quantum photonics; Three-dimensional circuits; Light","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900506638"

This work comprises three different tasks towards this goal: a numerical analysis to determine the optimal plasmon resonance conditions, a numerical analysis to select the best CMOS photodiode and the architecture proposal of a CMOS imager. A simulation with COMSOL of a Kretschmann configuration using CMOS/post-CMOS compatible materials, a silicon dioxide prism and a gold-water interface, showed an optimal metal thickness of 50 nm and the associated incidence resonance angle of 68.46. Then, a simulation with Silvaco ATLAS of two different CMOS photodiodes, a n-diff/p-sub and a n-well/p-sub, showed that the latter has a maximum quantum efficiency of 82 % and a photcurrent of 85 nA at 633 nm. This photodiode was selected as the photosensing element in a 20 × 20 μm2 pixel with a 61 % fill factor. A 32 × 32-pixel CMOS active column sensor (ACS) with fixed pattern noise (FPN) reduction was proposed. It includes non-correlated double sampling and double delta sampling schemes for noise handling. The reduction of the output's variance was demonstrated through Monte Carlo analysis. An experimental optical setup was used to characterize the performance of the imager, obtaining a conversion gain of 7.3 μV/e- and a photodiode capacitance of 22 fF, showing good agreement with the values obtained with electrical simulation of 5.2 μV/e- and 31 fF. The measured full-well saturation was of 118.8 × 103 e- or 2.4 V. Finally, pixel-FPN and column-FPN of 0.09 and 0.06 % respectively were obtained. The low FPN levels demonstrate the benefits of the ACS and noise reduction circuits implemented.

The profile of the force constant of the vibration associated with the reactive mode, k ξ (ξ), was also determined. We compare our results to the corresponding intramolecular proton transfers in the absence of a water molecule. The presence of water promotes the proton transfers, decreasing the energy barriers by about 12 - 15 kcal mol-1. This is due in part to much smaller bond angle changes being needed than when water is absent. The κ(ξ) profiles along the intrinsic reaction coordinates for the water-assisted processes show striking and intriguing differences in the transition regions. For the HS-N = S and HO-N = S systems, two κ(ξ) minima are obtained, whereas for HO-N = O only one minimum is found. The k ξ (ξ) show similar behavior in the transition regions. We propose that this fine structure reflects the degree of synchronicity of the two proton migrations in each case.

After running several simulations using two different datasets and performing two different analysis of the results, we show that the proposed algorithm, named neuro-evolutionary ensemble (NEVE), was able to learn the data set and to quickly respond to any drifts on the underlying data, indicating that our model can be a good alternative to address concept drift problems.

Achieving greater chemical accuracy or computational efficiency is highly desirable and this has motivated attempts to construct improved kineticenergy functionals. We hope that our results will ultimately aid in this endeavor but our aim in this chapter is conceptual rather than practical. We employ a dequantization procedure to obtain an exact expression for the kinetic energy of an N-electron system as the sum of an N-electron classical kinetic energy and an N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy arising from the quantum fluctuations that turn the classical momentum into the quantum momentum as in Nelson’s stochastic approach to quantum mechanics. We show that the N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy can be written as the sum of the Weizsäcker term, which is directly proportional to the Fisher information, and a purely quantum kinetic correlation term. We further show that the Weizsäcker term results from local quantum fluctuations while the purely quantum kinetic correlation term results from nonlocal quantum fluctuations. The N-electron classical kinetic energy is seen to be explicitly dependent on the phase of the N-electron wavefunction and this has implications for the development of accurate orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals. For stationary one-electron systems we show that there is a direct connection between the classical kinetic energy and the angular momentum. For nonstationary one-electron systems we show that the classical kinetic energy is complementary to the purely quantum kinetic energy which is directly proportional to the Fisher information. In this sense, the classical kinetic energy plays a role analogous to that of the Shannon information. © 2013 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

Theoretical calculations using monomer and dimer models of ILs showed that [BMIM] +[SCN]- and [BMIM]+[Cl]- ionic liquids capture gaseous Hg0, while [BMIM]+[PF 6]- shows no ability for this purpose. These findings are supported by experimental data obtained using particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) trace element analysis. Experimental and theoretical infrared data of the ILs were obtained before and after exposure to Hg. In all cases, no displacement of the bands was observed, indicating that the interaction does not significantly affect the force constants of substrate bonds. This suggests that van der Waals forces are the main forces responsible for mercury capture. Since the anion-absorbate is the driving force of the interaction, the largest charge-volume ratio of [Cl]- could explain the higher affinity for mercury sequestration of the [BMIM]+[Cl]- salt. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Atmospheric mercury; Ionic liquids; Quantum chemistry","Atmosphere; Computer Simulation; Energy Transfer; Environmental Pollutants; Imidazoles; Mercury; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Quantum Theory; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thiocyanates; anion; imidazole derivative; ionic liquid; mercury; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; imidazole derivative; mercury; pollutant; thiocyanic acid derivative; article; binding affinity; chemical bond; exposure; force; priority journal; theoretical study; X ray analysis; atmosphere; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; comparative study; computer simulation; energy transfer; infrared spectrophotometry; pollutant; quantum theory; spectrometry; structure activity relation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901726098"

Up to our knowledge, the only known unary nonregular languages recognized by 2D1CAs are those formed by strings having exponential length, where the exponents form some trivial unary regular language. In this paper, we present some non-trivial subsets of these languages. By using the input head as a second counter, we present simulations of two-way deterministic finite automata with linearly bounded counters and linear-space Turing machines.

This paper presents a polynomial time quantum attack on the Blum-Micali generator, which is considered secure against threats from classical computers. The proposed attack uses a Grover inspired procedure together with the quantum discrete logarithm, and is able to recover previous and future outputs of the generator under attack, thereby completely compromising its unpredictability. The attack can also be adapted to other generators, such as Blum-Micali generators with multiple hard-core predicates and generators from the Blum-Micali construction, and also to scenarios where the requirements on the bits are relaxed. Such attacks represent a threat to the security of the pseudorandom generators adopted in many real-world cryptosystems. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.","","Polynomial approximation; Quantum computers; Classical computing; Discrete logarithms; Polynomial-time; Pseudorandom generators; Quantum Computing; Real-world; Quantum cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876949581"

We use a direct numerical diagonalization to obtain the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the discretized Hamiltonian representing an electron-hole pair confined by a semiparabolic potential and interacting with each other via a Coulomb potential. Density matrix perturbation theory is used to compute the nonlinear optical susceptibilities due to third-harmonic generation and the corresponding nonlinear corrections to the refractive index and absorption coefficient. These quantities are analyzed as a function of ratio between the confinement length L and the exciton Bohr radius a0. The Coulomb potential degrades the uniformity of the level separation. We show that this effect promotes the emergence of multiple resonance peaks in the third-harmonic generation spectrum. In the weak confinement regime β = L/a0 ≫ 1, the third-order susceptibility is shown to decay as 1/β8 due to the prevalence of the hydrogenoid character of the exciton eigenstates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It was observed, for a wide variety of structures an enhancement in the transmission that can be explained as resulting from surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) waves propagating at the interface between the metallic film and the surrounding dielectric and/or substrate. In this work we utilize confocal microscope images as a useful tool to characterize the optical response of a set of concentric nanorings in the presence of SPP waves. We show for the first time the influence of the metal thickness on the light intensity profile. Reflected and transmitted light for concentric nanorings were observed under excitation of different laser wavelengths (405-633nm) as well as white light. Microscopy imaging with polarized light showed not only the spatial pattern of the radiation transmitted through these apertures but also a significant dependence of these patterns on the film thickness. The behavior was theoretically analyzed via basic principles as well as numerical simulation with standard software. A possible explanation is describing each ring as a source of radiation formed by two dipole systems, one electric dipole aligned to the applied electric field and a second one, a magnetic dipole, associated to a loop-antenna having an azimuthally non-homogeneous current dependence. This preliminary model is an ongoing study which may be useful to explain the behavior of the transmitted light. Analysis also showed the potential of confocal microscope for imaging nanostructures as well as for quantitative information on SPP excitation. © 2013 SPIE.","Confocal microscopy; Optical properties of thin films; Plasmonics; Polarization-dependent; Surface Plasmons; Surface waves; Transmission","Confocal microscopy; Dipole antennas; Electric fields; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Interfaces (materials); Laser excitation; Nanorings; Nanostructured materials; Optical properties; Plasmons; Semiconductor quantum dots; Surface waves; Transmissions; Confocal microscope images; Confocal microscopes; Optical properties of thin films; Plasmonics; Polarization-dependent; Quantitative information; Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP); Surface plasmons; Light transmission","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878307662"

Analysis involving the 3-5' and β-5' dimers was conducted following the standard procedure, i.e., rotating the monomers around the single bond. On the other hand, analysis of α-O-4 and β-O-4 dimers followed a distinct protocol with the aid of an interesting chemometric tool called Box-Behnken (BB) design. This methodology was applied with the aim of screening the most relevant dihedral angles. The results show that the conformational space for large systems with several dihedral angles can be mapped satisfactorily through the BB approach, reducing the number of dimensions to be treated at the quantum mechanical level.

We show that the discreteness of the charge causes a totally different behavior of the quantum circuit with respect to the classical circuit case. In particular, we show that in the case of fluctuating phase of a harmonic voltage source, the mesoscopic circuit would generate a quantum current with the same frequency of the voltage source one. Possible practical applications of mesoscopic circuits could be modeling the Josephson junction as discussed in this paper. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Mesoscopic electric circuits; stochastic processes","Electromotive force; Logic circuits; Quantum optics; Random processes; Superconducting materials; Harmonic voltages; Inductive circuits; Josephson junctions; Mesoscopic circuits; Mesoscopics; Quantum circuit; Quantum currents; Voltage source; Stochastic systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872157403"

The derivate over each pair of atoms in the molecule is defined as ∂G/∂S(vi,vj)=(f i-2fij+fj)/fij, where fi (or fj) and fij are the individual frequency of atom i (or j) and the reciprocal frequency of the atoms i and j, respectively. These frequencies characterize the participation intensity of atom pairs in S. Here, the event space is composed of molecular sub-graphs which participate in the formation of the G skeleton that could be complete (representing all possible connected sub-graphs) or comprised of sub-graphs of certain orders or types or combinations of these. The atom level graph derivative index, Δi, is expressed as a linear combination of all atom pair derivatives that include the atomic nuclei i. Global [total or local (group or atom-type)] indices are obtained by applying the so called invariants over a vector of Δi values. The novel MDs are validated using a data set of 28 alkyl-alcohols and other benchmark data sets proposed by the International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry. Also, the boiling point for the alcohols, the adrenergic blocking activity of N,N-dimethyl-2-halo- phenethylamines and physicochemical properties of polychlorinated biphenyls and octanes are modeled. These models exhibit satisfactory predictive power compared with other 0-3D indices implemented successfully by other researchers. In addition, tendencies of the proposed indices are investigated using examples of various types of molecular structures, including chain-lengthening, branching, heteroatoms-content, and multiple bonds. On the other hand, the relation of atom-based derivative indices with 17O NMR of a series of ethers and carbonyls reflects that the new MDs encode electronic, topological and steric information. Linear independence between the graph derivative indices and other 0-3D MDs is demonstrated by using principal component analysis on a dataset of 41 heterogeneous molecules. It is concluded that the graph derivative indices are independent indices containing important structural information to be used in QSPR/QSAR and drug design studies, and permit obtaining easier, more interpretable and robust mathematical models than the majority of those reported in the literature. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We exemplify their application by calculating the total scattering matrix of several types of quantum networks, such as star graphs and a chain of chaotic quantum dots, obtaining results with good agreement with the literature. Through a computational-time analysis we compare the efficiency of two algorithms for the simulation of a chain of chaotic quantum dots based on series association operations of (i) two-by-two centers and (ii) three-by-three ones. Empirical results point out that the algorithm (ii) is more efficient than (i) for small number of open scattering channels. A direct counting of floating point operations justifies quantitatively the superiority of the algorithm (i) for large number of open scattering channels. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Quantum dot; Quantum graph; Quantum network; Quantum scattering; Scattering matrix","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876323524"
