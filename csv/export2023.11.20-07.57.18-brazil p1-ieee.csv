Unfortunately, quantum bits (qubits) are extremely fragile and their state can be gradually or suddenly modified by intrinsic noise or external perturbation. In this paper, we target the sensitivity of quantum circuits to radiation-induced transient faults. We consider quantum circuit cuts that split the circuit into smaller independent portions, and understand how faults propagate in each portion. As we show, the cuts have different vulnerabilities, and our methodology successfully identifies the circuit portion that is more likely to contribute to the overall circuit error rate. Our evaluation shows that a circuit cut can have a 4.6 x higher probability than the other cuts, when corrupted, to modify the circuit output. Our study, identifying the most critical cuts, moves towards the possibility of implementing a selective hardening for quantum circuits.","1942-9401","978-1-6654-7355-2","10.1109/IOLTS56730.2022.9897308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9897308","Quantum Computing;Fault Tolerance;Fault Injection;Reliability Evaluation;Quantum Circuit Cutting","Sensitivity;Error analysis;Perturbation methods;Qubit;Reliability engineering;Circuit faults;Quantum circuit","integrated circuit reliability;probability;quantum computing;radiation hardening (electronics);transients","quantum circuits reliability;Quantum Computing;quantum bits;radiation-induced transient faults;quantum circuit cuts;smaller independent portions;circuit portion;circuit error rate;circuit cut;circuit output;critical cuts","","1","","28","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Qubits, the primary computing elements of quantum circuits, exploit the quantum physics proprieties to increase the parallelism and speed of computation drastically. Unfortunately, besides being intrinsically noisy, qubits have also been shown to be highly susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. The latest discoveries highlight a much higher radiation sensitivity of qubits than traditional transistors and identify a much more complex fault model than bit-flip.We propose a framework to identify the quantum circuits sensitivity to radiation-induced faults and the probability for a fault in a qubit to propagate to the output. Based on the latest studies and radiation experiments performed on real quantum machines, we model the transient faults in a qubit as a phase shift with a parametrized magnitude. Additionally, our framework can inject multiple qubit faults, tuning the phase shift magnitude based on the proximity of the qubit to the particle strike location. As we show in the paper, the proposed fault injector is highly flexible, and it can be used on both quantum circuit simulators and real quantum machines. We report the finding of more than 285, 249, 536 injections on the Qiskit simulator and 53, 248 injections on real IBM machines. We consider three quantum algorithms and identify the faults and qubits that are more likely to impact the output. We also consider the fault propagation dependence on the circuit scale, showing that the reliability profile for some quantum algorithms is scale-dependent, with increased impact from radiation-induced faults as we increase the number of qubits. Finally, we also consider multi qubits faults, showing that they are much more critical than single faults. The fault injector and the data presented in this paper are available in a public repository to allow further analysis.","2158-3927","978-1-6654-1693-1","10.1109/DSN53405.2022.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833778","Quantum Computing;Fault Tolerance;Fault Injection;Reliability Evaluation","Fault diagnosis;Sensitivity;Quantum algorithm;Computational modeling;Qubit;Circuit faults;Quantum circuit","circuit reliability;fault simulation;quantum computing;radiation hardening (electronics)","quantum physics proprieties;quantum circuits sensitivity;radiation-induced faults;quantum machines;multiple qubit faults;quantum circuit simulators;quantum algorithms;fault propagation dependence;quantum fault injector;quantum computing;QuFI;ionizing radiation;radiation sensitivity;bit-flip;qubit proximity;particle strike location","","3","","41","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard, this paper proposes the universal, scalable, efficient (USE), and easily manufacturable clocking scheme. It solves one of the most limiting factors of existing clock schemes, the implementation of feedback paths and easy routing of QCA-based circuits. Consequently, USE facilitates considerably the development of standard cell libraries and design tools for this technology, besides avoiding thermodynamics problems.

The current state-of-the-art approach to implementing n-qubit multi-controlled gates with a single target without relying on auxiliary qubits or approximate results involves the use of a quadratic number of single-qubit and CNOT gates. However, linear solutions are possible for the case where the controlled gate is special unitary, SU(2). The decomposition of an n-qubit multi-controlled SU(2) gate requires a circuit with a number of CNOT gates proportional to 28n. In this work, we present a new decomposition of n-qubit multi-controlled SU(2) gates that requires a circuit with a number of CNOT gates proportional to 20n and proportional to 16n if the SU(2) gate has at least one real-valued diagonal. The proposed algorithms produce the most efficient known circuits and improve the existing algorithm by reducing the number of CNOT gates and the overall circuit depth. As an application, we show the use of this decomposition for sparse quantum state preparation. Our results are further validated by demonstrating a proof of principle on a quantum device accessed through quantum cloud services.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3327102","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient?fico e Tecnol?gico(grant numbers:162052/2021-9,409506/2022-2,409513/2022-9); Coordena??o de Aperfei?oamento de Pessoal de N?vel Superior(grant numbers:Finance code 001); Funda??o de Amparo ?

The semiclassical theoretical model employed in the Monte Carlo device simulator is unsuccessful to describe some aspects of the multi-gate transistors that come from the quantum behavior of charge carriers. To take into consideration the space-quantization effects in these simulators, a quantum correction is necessary. We propose to include an effective potential in the Monte Carlo device simulator to address the wave-like behavior of electrons in n-type silicon FinFET and n-type silicon nanowire transistors. The effective potential has a unique parameter, which can be adjusted to find a line density using an Effective Potential-Poisson solver that matches with the line density calculated using a Schrodinger-Poisson solver. We demonstrated that using the effective potential model, the effect of the electron confinement is well described.","","978-1-6654-8714-6","10.1109/SBMICRO55822.2022.9881047","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(grant numbers:001); FAPESP(grant numbers:2019/15500-5); CNPq; FAPERGS(grant numbers:19/2551-0002286-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881047","quantum confinement;FinFET;nanowire transistors;effective potential","Electric potential;Solid modeling;Monte Carlo methods;Smoothing methods;Potential well;FinFETs;Silicon","elemental semiconductors;Monte Carlo methods;MOSFET;nanowires;Poisson equation;Schrodinger equation;semiconductor device models;silicon","Monte Carlo device simulator;multigate transistors;quantum behavior;space-quantization effects;quantum correction;n-type silicon FinFET;n-type silicon nanowire transistors;Effective Potential-Poisson solver;effective potential model;modeling quantum confinement;Particle-based Monte Carlo device simulators;semiclassical theoretical model","","2","","18","IEEE","16 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These differences induce significant changes in the solar energy conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cells, as previously reported. In this work, a systematic investigation was carried out using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and Laplace DLTS measurements on control samples and solar cell devices, which have clearly shown that electrically active traps play an important role in the device figures of merit, such as open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and shunt resistance. In particular, it was found that the well-known EL2 defect negatively affects both the open circuit voltage and shunt resistance, more in structures containing QDs, as a consequence of the temperature cycle required to deposit them. Other unidentified defects, that are absent in samples in which the QDs were annealed at 700 °C, contribute to a reduction of the short circuit current, as they increase the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.

However, this engineering process demands considerable time and expert knowledge, which leads to an increasing interest in automating the design of deep architectures. Several new algorithms have been proposed to address the neural architecture search problem, but many of them require significant computational resources. Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEA) have their roots on quantum computing principles and present promising results in respect to faster convergence. In this work, we propose Q-NAS (Quantum-inspired Neural Architecture Search): a quantum-inspired algorithm to search for deep neural architectures by assembling substructures and optimizing some numerical hyperparameters. We present the first results applying Q-NAS on the CIFAR-10 dataset using only 20 K80 GPUs for about 50 hours.

These methods have their limitations, as the lack of a back-propagation technique and barren plateaus. This work proposes an algorithm to reduce state preparation circuit depth by offloading computational complexity to a classical computer. The initialized quantum state can be exact or an approximation, and we show that the approximation is better on today’s quantum processors than the initialization of the original state.
