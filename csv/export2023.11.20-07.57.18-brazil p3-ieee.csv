"Thermal Compensation Method for Piezoresistive Pressure Transducer","R. d. S. Pereira; C. A.

Usually, there is a need for an additional component to ensure a proper temperature-compensated signal for the sensors. In this article, we describe a method for the sensor thermal compensation that uses only the electrical signal produced by the pressure sensors themselves, without the need of additional measurements. The method proved to be effective while also ensuring a significant reduction in the measurement error.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3092789","PADIS Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466132","Measurement error;piezoresistive pressure sensor;piezoresistor;pressure sensor;thermal compensation","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Piezoresistance;Bridge circuits;Mathematical model;Sensors;Pressure sensors","compensation;measurement errors;piezoresistive devices;pressure measurement;pressure sensors;pressure transducers;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","thermal compensation method;piezoresistive pressure transducer;piezoresistive pressure sensors;electrical signal;temperature-compensated signal;measurement error","","7","","18","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Method for Measuring Torque of Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors Without Any Mechanical Sensor","W. L. Silva; A. M. N. Lima; A.

The method is not invasive, since it does not rely on mechanical sensors and only the measurement of the stator current is required. The slip and the rotational speed of the motor are estimated from the spectrogram of the stator current signal either in stationary or in nonstationary operating conditions. The torque is estimated from the ratio of the estimated slip and the rated one. A test platform equipped with a rotational speed sensor and a dc motor for measuring the torque of a three-phase induction motor fed by a pulsewidth-modulated voltage source inverter operating under scalar and vector control was implemented to verify the correctness of the proposed method. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the close agreement between the estimated values of the speed and torque obtained with the proposed method and the ones that are obtained from direct measurement.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2014.2371192","Research Support Foundation of the State of Bahia; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development through the Development Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975173","Rotating machine measurements;signal processing;slot harmonics;spectral analysis;speed measurement;squirrel-cage induction motor;torque measurement.;Rotating machine measurements;signal processing;slot harmonics;spectral analysis;speed measurement;squirrel-cage induction motor;torque measurement","Induction motors;Torque;Rotors;Harmonic analysis;Velocity control;DC motors;Current measurement","squirrel cage motors;stators;torque measurement;velocity measurement","pulsewidth-modulated voltage source inverter;torque measurement;dc motor;rotational speed sensor;test platform;stator current measurement;three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors","","15","","28","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is applied to ratio and phase displacement measurements over a wide frequency range. A Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity analysis was carried out to properly estimate the model uncertainty. The modeling tool proved to be an advantageous alternative with suitable adherence to the traced points, not exceeding a few parts in 106. Real and imaginary parts can be taken into account in the same fitting, preserving their correlation for the uncertainty estimation. Such a black-box approach can also help to estimate intermediate and above limit points since the transfer function is given by the tool.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3047956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310699","Modeling;Monte Carlo simulation;power quality (PQ);rational functions;sensitivity analysis;single tone approach;transducer;vector fitting (VF);voltage divider","Frequency measurement;Voltage measurement;Uncertainty;Impedance measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Bridge circuits;Resistors","displacement measurement;estimation theory;measurement uncertainty;Monte Carlo methods;phase measurement;sensitivity analysis;vectors;voltage dividers","VF tool;RVD;transfer function;Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity analysis;phase displacement measurements;vector fitting tool;uncertainty evaluation;rational functions;resistive voltage divider","","1","","14","IEEE","29 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
