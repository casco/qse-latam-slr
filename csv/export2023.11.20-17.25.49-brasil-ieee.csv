Besides, advancements in quantum computers are gradually posing a threat to public key encryption technology. Without proper security measures, fraudsters may easily gain access to one's personal and sensitive data. The result of the third round of NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process for standardization of public-key cryptography systems brought CRYSTALS-Kyber as the first mechanism selected for key encapsulation. The aim of this study is to provide the specification of a reconfigurable CRYSTAL-Kyber accelerator using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) technology. Our architecture requires about 2200 LUTs, 3001 FFs and 28 DSP on a low-cost Zynq FPGA (XC7Z020-1 CLG400C).

These differences induce significant changes in the solar energy conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cells, as previously reported. In this work, a systematic investigation was carried out using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and Laplace DLTS measurements on control samples and solar cell devices, which have clearly shown that electrically active traps play an important role in the device figures of merit, such as open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and shunt resistance. In particular, it was found that the well-known EL2 defect negatively affects both the open circuit voltage and shunt resistance, more in structures containing QDs, as a consequence of the temperature cycle required to deposit them. Other unidentified defects, that are absent in samples in which the QDs were annealed at 700 °C, contribute to a reduction of the short circuit current, as they increase the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.

Because of the difficulty in finding an exact solution, the use of heuristics to address the problem is a common practice. When only the hard constraints are considered, the timetabling problem can be reduced to graph vertex coloring. This similarity between both problems has motivated the use of graph coloring heuristics as a means to solve the timetabling problem. We propose the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm as a heuristic to solve the school timetabling problem. The QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that can be used to address combinatorial optimization problems.

While any oblivious transfer protocol secure against malicious adversaries can be used to implement commitment, the reduction does not work if the oblivious transfer protocol is only secure against honest-but-curious adversaries.

However, the ballistic transport within the 1D semiconducting CNT channel is largely determined by charge injection from the contacts rendering reliable theoretical predictions of the transistor performance difficult. Based on a simplified heterojunction like contact model, we demonstrate by solving the Schrödinger-Poisson equations that aggressive scaling will rely on a careful balance between two components of the injected charges, one responsible for the formation of near-contact barriers and the other carrying the current. Excellent electrostatic gate control (e.g. employing thin gate oxides) may then enable transistor scaling until the onset of direct source-drain tunneling.","1946-1577","978-1-4673-5736-4","10.1109/SISPAD.2013.6650599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650599","CNTFET;1D-electronics;Schrödinger equation;quantum transport;subthreshold slope;short channel","CNTFETs;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Carbon nanotubes;Electron tubes;Electric potential","ballistic transport;carbon nanotube field effect transistors;Schrodinger equation","source-drain tunneling;Schrodinger-Poisson equations;heterojunction like contact model;transistor performance;charge injection;ballistic transport;transistor technology;1D-electronics;short-channel CNTFET;subthreshold slope;near-contact barriers","","9","","18","IEEE","31 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the theoretical definitions of power under nonsinusoidal conditions and their outcomes are presented and two of them are chosen as the focus to determine which one is the most appropriate for billing: nonactive power and fundamental reactive power. The regulatory framework of different countries is then analyzed and compared with the theoretical definitions. Subsequently, different reactive power measurement methods are analyzed and their outputs are again compared with the definitions. Simulations performed with typical nonsinusoidal voltage and current signals show that several measurement techniques can easily be used for fundamental reactive power measurement, whereas the measurement of nonactive power requires more effort. Finally, a regulatory comparison of the pros and cons of each reactive power quantity is conducted. It is concluded that the surplus of reactive power in electricity grids should be controlled via fundamental reactive power (or displacement power factor), since it is independent of the harmonic distortion, the responsibility for it can be easily assigned, and it is easy to be measured with the use of several simple electronic measurement techniques.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2017.2673058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879815","Harmonic distortion;Q measurement;reactive power;wavelet transforms","Reactive power;Power measurement;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Harmonic analysis;Power system harmonics;Distortion measurement","harmonic distortion;power measurement;reactive power;wavelet transforms","reactive power billing;low-voltage systems;nonsinusoidal conditions;reactive power measurement;harmonic distortion;wavelet transforms","","30","","28","IEEE","16 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
