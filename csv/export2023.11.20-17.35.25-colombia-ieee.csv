In quantum computing (QC), classical ML models are currently being used to discriminate in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signal data to discriminate between quantum states, which is a fundamental QC operation. In our research we propose a Quantum K-Means (QK-Means) clustering technique to discriminate quantum states on the IBM Bogota quantum device, and compare its performance to the K-Means technique (its classical counterpart). We used both algorithms to perform a correlation analysis and probe cross-talk between couples of qubits on the device. We observed that QK-Means obtained test and training scores at par with the classical K-Means, and testing scores that were marginally lower than K-Means when the clusters weren’t visually separable. The training times for QK-Means were observed to be at par with an implementation of the K-Means that was not optimized. In this case, we concluded a weak correlation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.2 on the (1, 2) and (2, 3) qubit couples. After analyzing the training scores, we also conclude that the 1 qubit has the worst performance at readout evidenced by the signal data not being visually separable and the low scores obtained on both clustering algorithms compared to the other qubits. Its poor performance is further verified by the calibration data showing a high readout error of 8,4%. This technique can be used to find correlations present in readout of quantum circuits and to determine cross-talk.","","978-1-6654-1691-7","10.1109/QCE52317.2021.00088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605339","Quantum Computing;Machine Learning;Quantum Machine Learning;K-Means;QK-Means","Training;Performance evaluation;Correlation;Qubit;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning;Quantum state","calibration;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;quality control;quantum computing","quantum states;IBM Bogota quantum device;K-Means technique;correlation analysis;probe cross-talk;QK-Means;training scores;classical K-Means;signal data;quantum circuits;Quantum machine learning;quantum computers;quantum computing;classical ML models;fundamental QC operation;Quantum K-Means clustering technique","","3","","13","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By making use of BLAS operations, we propose, implement and analyze a quantum k-means (qk-means) algorithm with a low time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(NK log(D)I/C)$ to apply it to the fundamental problem of discriminating quantum states at readout. Discriminating quantum states allows the identification of quantum states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ from low-level in-phase and quadrature signal (IQ) data, and can be done using custom ML models. In order to reduce dependency on a classical computer, we use the qk-means to perform state discrimination on the IBMQ Bogota device and managed to find assignment fidelities of up to 98.7% that were only marginally lower than that of the k-means algorithm. We also performed a cross-talk benchmark on the quantum device by applying both algorithms to perform state discrimination on a combination of quantum states and using Pearson Correlation coefficients and assignment fidelities of discrimination results to conclude on the presence of cross-talk on qubits. Evidence shows cross-talk in the (1, 2) and (2, 3) neighboring qubit couples for the analyzed device.","","978-1-6654-2332-8","10.1109/ICRC53822.2021.00018","Department of Energy; ASCR Quantum Testbed Pathfinder program; Office of Science; Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743185","Quantum Computing;Machine Learning;Quantum Machine Learning;K-Means;QK-Means;Crosstalk","Training;Performance evaluation;Machine learning algorithms;Qubit;Machine learning;Quantum state;Benchmark testing","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);linear algebra;quantum computing","quantum states;quantum machine learning algorithms;machine learning field;quantum speedups;quantum k-means;state discrimination;quantum device","","","","41","IEEE","31 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a suitable approach for high-reliability electrical characterization of vegetable tissues by using a high-accuracy impedance spectrum measurement based on a structured algorithm, a flexible IS microsystem, and fractional-order (FO) models. The designed microsystem uses minimal discrete circuits and a programmable mixed-signal circuit, and it is validated by using EEMs of integer-order (IO), that is, the IS measures were compared with the simulation results. Also, impedance spectrum measures of vegetable tissues are carried out using the microsystem. In this case, five EEMs described by IO and FO differential equations are used to perform the parametric optimization using the Nelder-Mead “simplex” algorithm. Taking into account the obtained simulation results and experimental measures, it is possible to mention that the structured approach is suitable for applications that require to measure the bioimpedance over a spread spectrum, such as electrical IS (EIS) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT).","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2019.2904131","Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia), Colombia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686216","Characterization;fractional calculus;impedance spectroscopy (IS);parameter estimation;system implementation","Impedance;Impedance measurement;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Discrete Fourier transforms;Micromechanical devices","bioelectric phenomena;biological tissues;electric impedance;electric impedance imaging;electric impedance measurement;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","structured approach;impedance spectroscopy microsystem;fractional-order electrical characterization;vegetable tissues;spread spectrum;simple noninvasive technique;equivalent electrical model;high-reliability electrical characterization;high-accuracy impedance spectrum measurement;structured algorithm;fractional-order models;IS measures;electrical impedance tomography;Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm","","15","","36","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system was developed to be applied in high-viscous-oil/water/gas flow arranged in different flow patterns, with the three fluids present simultaneously in a crossing point. The primary measurement is based on a simpler and reliable digital in-phase/quadrature (IQ) demodulator and a wire-mesh sensor (WMS), but the system is capable of including different types of primary measurements. Dynamic three-phase flow tests were carried out to verify the system performance and compare its results with the ones obtained by quick-closing valves (QCVs) and a high-speed video camera. In situ volumetric fractions and flow patterns were compared. The experiments were conducted in a vertical glass pipe of 50-mm i.d. and 12-m height. The observed three-phase flow patterns were water-continuous churn flow with dispersed bubbles and oil drops (WChBoDo), water-continuous slug flow with Taylor bubbles, spherical bubbles, and oil drops (WPiBoDo), and oil-continuous slug flow with Taylor bubbles, spherical bubbles, and water drops (OPiBoDi). Compared with the measurements using QCVs, the average relative errors of the measured volumetric phase fractions were 12% for water, 13% for air, and 22% for oil. The experimental results, including the details of the flow inside the pipe, the phase distributions, and the objective characterization of flow patterns, suggest that the proposed system is a promising option for three-phase flow-related studies and developments. The proposed technique can reach 8930 frames/s with a  $16\times16$  WMS.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3156990","PETROBRAS through the project “Comparação entre Métodos de Elevação Artificial para Óleos Viscosos com Gás”(grant numbers:0050.0082074.13.9); CNPq “Bolsa de produtividade”(grant numbers:311057/2020-9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9729219","Flow patterns;impedance measurement;three-phase flow;tomography;wire-mesh","Oils;Tomography;Wires;Permittivity measurement;Phase measurement;Laboratories;Viscosity","bubbles;flow visualisation;oils;pattern formation;pipe flow;tomography;two-phase flow;water","primary measurement;system performance;high-speed video camera;three-phase flow patterns;water-continuous churn flow;oil drops;water-continuous slug flow;Taylor bubbles;spherical bubbles;oil-continuous slug flow;water drops;volumetric phase fractions;phase distributions;three-phase flow-related studies;three-phase flow tomography system;wire-mesh sensor;pipe flow;H2O","","","","43","IEEE","4 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, a dose reduction in mammography is desirable. At the same time, there is a demand for a higher spatial resolution in mammographic imaging. The most promising way to achieve these goals is the use of advanced photon-processing semiconductor X-ray detectors with optimum sensor materials. This study addresses the investigation of the optimum semiconductor sensor material for mammography in combination with the photon-processing detector Medipix3RX. The influence of K-shell fluorescence from the sensor material on the achievable contrast-to-noise ratio is investigated, as well as the attenuation efficiency. The three different sensor materials, CdTe, GaAs, and Si are studied, showing advances of CdTe-sensors for mammography. Furthermore, a comparison of the contrast-to-noise ratio between a clinical Se-detector and Medipix3RX detectors with Si- and CdTe-sensors is shown using a self-produced mammography phantom that is based on real human tissue.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.3004648","German Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) through the MAMMOSECUR Förderkennzeichen Project(grant numbers:01DN19002); Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) Project(grant numbers:80740-055-2019); Faculty of Science, Universidad de los Andes(grant numbers:P18.160322.001-15FISI01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123905","CdTe;contrast-to-noise ratio;GaAs;human phantom;mammography;Medipix3RX;spatial resolution;X-ray attenuation efficiency","Detectors;II-VI semiconductor materials;Cadmium compounds;Photonics;Gallium arsenide;Silicon;Phantoms","biological organs;biological tissues;cadmium compounds;cancer;chemical sensors;diagnostic radiography;elemental semiconductors;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;II-VI semiconductors;mammography;medical image processing;phantoms;selenium;semiconductor counters;X-ray detection","X-ray exposure;semiconductor sensor material;CdTe-sensors;clinical Se-detector;mammography phantom;Medipix3RX photon-processing detector;photon-processing semiconductor X-ray detectors;breast cancer;mammographic imaging;K-shell fluorescence;Si-sensors;human tissue;GaAs;Si;CdTe;Se","Arsenicals;Cadmium Compounds;Female;Gallium;Humans;Mammography;Quantum Dots;Tellurium","9","","66","CCBY","24 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is intended to enhance the performance of selective shunt active power compensators (SAPCs). The measurements system includes a synchronization structure to estimate the fundamental positive-sequence component of grid voltages in distorted and asymmetric three-phase systems. The synchronization signal is used by a sliding window discrete Fourier transformation (SDFT) recursive algorithm to obtain the fundamental components of the voltages and currents. This algorithm extremely reduces the computational cost compared with the classic SDFT implementation. This strategy allows for a sample-by-sample quasicontinuous calculation of all power quantities, as well as the nonefficient currents. These magnitudes had been used to generate the reference currents for an SAPC achieving a quasicontinuous compensation of the nonefficient power quantities. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed measurements system operates correctly under all electrical power network conditions.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2013.2270901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555928","Harmonics;IEEE Std 1459;measurements system;power quality;power systems;unbalanced power","IEEE standards;Power systems;Power system measurements;Power quality;Harmonic analysis","compensation;discrete Fourier transforms;IEEE standards;power grids;power measurement;power supply quality;power system measurement;synchronisation","IEEE Std. 1459 standard;power magnitude measurement system;power quality improvement structure;selective shunt active power compensator;SAPC;synchronization structure;fundamental positive-sequence component;grid voltage;asymmetric three-phase system;sliding window discrete Fourier transformation recursive algorithm;SDFT recursive algorithm;sample-by-sample quasicontinuous compensation calculation;reference current generation;nonefficient power quantity;electrical power network condition","","14","","47","IEEE","9 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their fast response and simple implementation compensate for a low spectral resolution. In this article, we are filling a gap identified in the literature on multispectral systems by presenting a detailed design of a light controller, as well as a characterization of the whole system by means of a correlation and a repeatability analysis. We use a reference color target to assess accuracy and precision by comparing our system with high-performance hyperspectral equipment used in fruit quality control. The system captures multispectral images (MSIs) with 15 different wavelengths (λ ∈ [410 950] nm). The main finding is a Pearson correlation index above 80% (ρ > 0.8) with a variance in the measure within 10% (σ2 <; 0.1). We also examine the characteristics of the instrument at a maximum speed of 8 MSIs/s although this entails sacrificing precision (σ2 <; 0.3).","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3010109","Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation - Colciencias under the program Doctorados Nacionales Colciencias ref. 647-2014; INIA RTA2015-00078-00-00 and AEI PID2019-107347RR-C31; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143139","Calibration;characterization;lighting control;measure instrument;multispectral imaging (MSI);narrow-band;power LED","Light emitting diodes;Cameras;Lighting;Hyperspectral imaging;Multispectral imaging;Green products;Bandwidth","hyperspectral imaging;image capture;image colour analysis;light emitting diodes;optical control;optical design techniques;optical images;spectral line narrowing;statistical analysis","multispectral image capture;spectral resolution;narrow bandwidth power LED;light controller;repeatability analysis;high-performance hyperspectral equipment;fruit quality control;Pearson correlation index","","7","","61","IEEE","17 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
