This has made it possible to provide good practices to increase the quality of software products and services. However, quality should not only be qualitative but quantitative through the use of metrics. Therefore, this article proposes metrics for software development based on the ISO/IEC 29110 standard.

In this work, we describe a batching implementation of our custom software that speeds the experimental run-time through the reduction of communication and upload times. Reducing the code upload time during experimental runs improves system performance by mitigating the effects of drift. We demonstrate this implementation through a set of quantum chemistry experiments using a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

However, the present communication technologies have several security related issues which is required to provide secure end to end connectivity among services. Moreover, due to recent, rapid growth of quantum technologies, most common security mechanisms considered secure today may be soon imperilled. Thus, the modern security mechanisms during their construction also require the power of quantum technologies to resist various potential attacks from quantum computers. Because of its characteristics, quantum walks (QW) is considered as a universal quantum computation paradigm that can be accepted as an excellent key generator. In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61%, and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992820","Menoufia University, Egypt; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center)(grant numbers:IITP-2020-2016-0-00312); IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation); Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingenieria y Ciencias and CONACyT(grant numbers:SNI 41594); Fronteras de la Ciencia(grant numbers:1007); National Centre for Research and Development, Poland under Gospostrateg Programme framework and more specifically 5G@PL Project en-titled Deployment of 5G network in Polish Market under Grant Gospostrateg(grant numbers:1/383021/19/NCBR/2018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9088144","Quantum walks;lightweight cipher;data transfer in IoT;image encryption;edge computing;wireless communication","Quantum computing;Encryption;Internet of Things;Data transfer;Ciphers","entropy;Internet of Things;quantum computing;quantum cryptography","quantum walks;IoT networks;communication technologies;quantum technologies;security mechanisms;quantum computers;universal quantum computation;lightweight image encryption scheme;secure data transfer;internet-of-things;wireless networking;edge computing;encryption algorithm;encrypted images","","60","","49","CCBY","6 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In both cases, large, complex optimization problems can be expressed in terms of combinations of simpler problems. A key challenge in problem set-up lies in finding the coefficients for the constituent sub-problems. These need to be chosen such that the function is minimized on valid inputs and is higher elsewhere. One difficulty is that it is not possible in general to solve for a sub-problem’s coefficients without introducing ancillary variables, the number of which and their corresponding per-row values being unknown a priori. These unknowns lead to solving for a sub-problem’s coefficients being an NP-complete problem.In this paper we present a simple heuristic that considers a prioritized subset of the exponential number of possibilities for each per-row ancillary variable. Using this heuristic, coefficients can be found substantially faster than would be possible using a brute-force search and with less software complexity than is required by prior approaches.","","978-1-6654-1691-7","10.1109/QCE52317.2021.00039","Los Alamos National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605331","truth tables;QUBO;quantum annealing;quantum computing","Computers;Quantum computing;Codes;Oceans;Conferences;Logic gates;Software","Boolean functions;computational complexity;optimisation;quantum computing","simple heuristic;quadratic pseudoBoolean function;quadratic functions;real-valued coefficients;native input;quantum annealers;circuitmodel quantum computers;complex optimization problems;simpler problems;constituent sub-problems;ancillary variables;per-row values;NP-complete problem;heuristic coefficients","","1","","19","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research work introduces the SCAPS software to model the CIGSe TFSC. From the simulated results, the solar cell performance was enhanced with an increase in thickness of the CIGSe by improving the absorption of photons. The recombination centers for the generated charge carriers were increased at higher carrier concentrations of the CIGSe. The efficiency was slightly improved when CdS thickness is increased from 20 to 100 nm. The collection of generated charge carriers was enhanced with a rise in carrier concentration of CdS, which increases the device performance. After analyzing these results, the optimized efficiency of 27.32% was noticed for CIGSe TFSC. The quantum efficiency (QE) results confirmed that the photons whose wavelength value lower than 900 nm are absorbed in the device. Moreover, the experimental results of CIGSe and CdS thin films are studied in this simulation. It was observed that the device’s performance was reduced with an increase in the thickness of the CdS. Hence, SCAPS software could be useful for designing the device experimentally.","2642-3766","978-1-6654-5508-4","10.1109/CCE56709.2022.9976014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976014","Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe);cadmium sulfide (CdS);hybrid deposition method;SCAPS software;CIGSe TFSC","Performance evaluation;Photovoltaic systems;Temperature;Charge carriers;Absorption;Photovoltaic cells;Radiative recombination","cadmium compounds;carrier density;copper compounds;gallium compounds;II-VI semiconductors;indium compounds;power system simulation;semiconductor thin films;solar cells;ternary semiconductors","carrier concentration;CdS/bin;material properties;quantum efficiency;SCAPS software;size 20.0 nm to 100.0 nm;solar cell performance;TFSC;thickness;thin films","","","","24","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coaxial microcalorimeters allow both broadband operation and power substitution through its feeding line; however, characterization and fabrication of millimeter-wave coaxial lines are technologically difficult. Thus, the design of the microcalorimeter is described, as well as the RF performance of its adiabatic lines. To overcome the lack of coaxial TSs up to 50 GHz, commercially available 2.4-mm thermoelectric power sensors are investigated to use them as low-frequency (LF) power substitution detectors. The effective efficiency is measured in the microcalorimeter by means of calorimetric measurements and the substitution of LF power; the developed measurement procedure is presented as well as the measurement results and the uncertainty analysis. The theoretical basis for the procedure employed to determine the microcalorimeter correction factor, based on the use of specially constructed open and short standards, is described with the measurement results and uncertainties are shown as well. To avoid the drift of the millimeter-wave power during the calorimetric measurements, a novel software leveling loop method for thermoelectric power sensors was devised. This method allows to keep the RF power level variations less than 100 ppm and being a straightforward solution to recent complex hardware realizations.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3024340","Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM); Physical Metrology for National Strategic Needs; Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science(grant numbers:KRISS-2020-GP2020-0002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9198916","Electromagnetic measurements;measurement standards;metrology;microcalorimeter;power measurement;thermoelectric sensors;traceability;transfer standards (TSs)","Standards;Radio frequency;Thermal sensors;Power measurement;Temperature measurement;Transmission line measurements","calorimeters;coaxial cables;electric sensing devices;measurement uncertainty;microwave measurement;millimetre wave measurement;power measurement;temperature measurement;temperature sensors;thermoelectricity;transfer standards","software leveling loop method;Mexico;coaxial TS;RF power level variations;microcalorimeter correction factor;calorimetric measurements;low-frequency power substitution detectors;thermoelectric power sensors;adiabatic lines;millimeter-wave coaxial lines;feeding line;thermoelectric-type transfer standards;coaxial microcalorimeter system;microwave power standard;millimeter-wave power standard;size 2.4 mm","","","","28","IEEE","16 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
