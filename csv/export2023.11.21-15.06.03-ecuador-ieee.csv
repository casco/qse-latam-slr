"Intercept-Resend Attack on Quantum Key Distribution Protocols with Two, Three and Four-State Systems: Comparative Analysis","G.

Starting from the mathematical models, this study explores quantum alternatives to traditional key distribution protocols and involves software implementations of the quantum key distribution protocols with two, three and four-state systems. The paper presents the results obtained on case of the cybernetic attack simulation, type Intercept-Resend - the well known attack on quantum world, over the each protocol. Presence of the eavesdropper is determined by calculating the errors obtained at the end of transmission through quantum channel. The method Quantum Error Rate for detecting the eavesdropper can be applied to the majority key distribution systems, each system having its own acceptable error rate. Starting from the same size of input data, the paper presents an analysis of the data obtained on cybernetic attack simulations and analyzes the percentage of errors by comparison with the dimensions of the cryptographic keys obtained in the case of each protocol.","","978-1-4673-8611-1","10.1109/ICISSEC.2015.7371010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371010","","Protocols;Receivers;Error analysis;Software;Encryption;Quantum cryptography","cryptographic protocols;quantum cryptography;software engineering","intercept-resend attack;quantum key distribution protocols;mathematical models;software implementations;cybernetic attack simulation;cryptographic keys","","1","","14","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For better multi-core load balancing, memory utilization, and simulation efficiency, this research presented a high-performance grover method simulation that combines the benefits of grover's technique with the parallel of cloud computing.

As compared to classical cryptography, which implies different mathematical algorithms to secure the information, quantum cryptography focuses on the physical support of the information. The process of information transmission or stocking is realized by the intermediation of a physical support, for example the photons transmitted by optical fiber or the electrons from the electricity. Communication security can be regarded as securing the physical support of the carrier of the information - in our case the photons from the optical fiber. Consequently, how and what an attacker can find out depends exclusively on the laws of physics.

This paper presents the entropy and p-value tests performed on classical and quantum random number generators, in order to check the randomness of the generated output data.

Kurtosis and negative entropy are two classic and popular indices to measure the sparsity of impulsive transients, and they are prone to be affected by impulsive noise. The purpose of this article is twofold. Theoretically, new propositions and their proofs are proposed to illustrate how kurtosis and negative entropy can help to characterize impulsive transients and why they are affected by impulsive noise. Next, a weighted residual regression-based index is proposed to relieve the sensitivity of kurtosis and entropy to impulsive noise and to provide monotonic trends for gear and bearing degradation assessment. Theoretical results show that kurtosis and negative entropy are changed with the length of nonimpulsive regions of impulsive transients. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better incipient fault detection ability and monotonic trending ability than kurtosis and negative entropy for bearing and gear health monitoring and degradation assessment.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3031125","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51975355,71774130); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223728","Condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;prognostics and health management (PHM);system health monitoring;weighted residual regression","Entropy;Transient analysis;Monitoring;Market research;Indexes;Band-pass filters;Degradation","condition monitoring;entropy;fault diagnosis;gears;impulse noise;machine bearings;regression analysis;statistical distributions","kurtosis;negative entropy;impulsive transients;impulsive noise;weighted residual regression-based index;bearing degradation assessment;gear health monitoring;system health monitoring;prognostics and health management;PHM;condition monitoring;degradation trends;monotonic trending;health indices;nonimpulsive regions;incipient fault detection;bearing health monitoring","","7","","22","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
