Knowledge management and strategic intelligence are transformative activities of society, implicitly connected with innovation in sustainability and business changes that result in greater organizational potential, and in a knowledge economy. The objective of Intelligence is to obtain value from data and information by analyzing a large amount of data. Mining and mineral extraction processes are a sector that due to its complexity requires tools for decision-making that ensure efficiency and competitive position without forgetting the stakeholders. Therefore, this study performs a conceptual and bibliometric analysis of production in the area of Knowledge Management and Intelligence quantifying performance indicators, identifying the main research areas and authors, and evaluating the development of the knowledge field using VOSviewer as bibliometric analysis software.","","978-1-7281-9677-0","10.1109/DASA51403.2020.9317053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317053","knowledge management;decision-making;scientific parks;innovation;Quantum Zacatecas;strategic intelligence;competitive intelligence;mining 4.0","Decision making;Knowledge management;Data mining;Bibliometrics;Tools;Mining industry;Sustainable development","decision making;knowledge management;mining industry;organisational aspects","knowledge field;strategic intelligence;knowledge management;decision-making;mining industry;knowledge society;knowledge economy;mineral extraction;intelligence quantifying performance indicators;VOSviewer;bibliometric analysis software","","","","19","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a method that combines a low loss of the Ti-indiffused technology and passive permanent trimming of DLW. Two techniques of trimming, i.e., (i) micro-inscription of refractive index change and (ii) micro-machining of loading metal films, have been investigated. We demonstrate that a local micro-scale change of refractive index due to LN modification can be efficiently used for precise adjustment of the splitting ratio of waveguide optical splitters and couplers and does not increase the optical loss. The other trimming method is loading of a metal film on top of a waveguide and its treatment with a laser beam, as shown in fig. la. It is based on the dependence of the plazmon polariton excitation efficiency on the metal film thickness. It has been experimentally found that the insertion loss of a single-mode waveguide change from 0.1 dB/mm for 400 nm aluminium loading film to more than 1 6 dB/mm for a substantially thinner one. The laser beam of a Ti: Sapphire femtosecond laser (Avesta Project, λ = 800 nm) with a pulse duration of 100 fs and repetition rate of 80 MHz the average power of which was controlled in the range 20+100 mW was focused by an Olympus objective (40x, NA = 0.75). To position the sample with respect to the laser beam, a precise nanopositioning system was used. The zigzag track on the 100-nm aluminium loading film placed on the single mode Ti-indiffused channel waveguide allowed a precise control of trimming.","","978-1-5090-6736-7","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8087294","","Optical waveguides;Ultrafast optics;Optical films;Waveguide lasers;Optical refraction;Optical variables control","aluminium;high-speed optical techniques;integrated optics;laser beam machining;laser beams;lithium compounds;metallic thin films;optical beam splitters;optical couplers;optical fabrication;optical losses;optical materials;optical waveguides;polaritons;refractive index;surface plasmons","femtosecond laser microinscription;femtosecond laser micromachining;high performance lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits;Ti-indiffused technology;passive permanent trimming;DLW;refractive index change;loading metal films;LN modification;splitting ratio;waveguide optical splitters;optical couplers;optical loss;laser beam;plazmon polariton excitation efficiency;metal film thickness;insertion loss;single-mode waveguide change;aluminium loading film;Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser;pulse duration;repetition rate;Olympus objective;nanopositioning system;single mode Ti-indiffused channel waveguide;wavelength 800 nm;time 100 fs;size 100 nm;Al;LiNbO3","","","","3","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present work proposes an ultra-compact organic vertical-cavity microlaser based on an active micro-pillar design, and explores its potential applications as a highly integrated gas sensor. The vertical-cavity is realized by embedding an organic Rhodamine 6G doped SiO2 gain layer inside one small cavity which is formed by distributed bragg reflectors and a high contrast grating thin layer. The hybrid structure of top reflector of cavity enables part of the field to interact with the medium surrounding the cavity, while maintaining a high confinement factor, low lasing threshold, and single-mode operation around 570 nm. In particular, the vertical microlaser can be used as a convenient and versatile wavelength-interrogation sensing architecture, whereby variations of the laser spectral line can be correlated to small changes in the gas concentration. Through using full-wave electromagnetic simulations, we obtain a significantly improved figure of merit (441 RIU-1) for the bulk sensitivity. The vertical architecture and small design of the proposed micro-laser-based sensor render it attractive for highly integrated remote sensing of gases.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2020.3025567","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61804036); Zhejiang Province Commonweal Project(grant numbers:LGJ20A040001); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFE0120000); Zhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2019C04003); National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship(grant numbers:201910336053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201499","Hybrid micropillar cavity;laser;high-index-contrast grating;wavelength tuning;gas detection","Cavity resonators;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Mathematical model;Gas lasers;Optical sensors;Time-domain analysis","diffraction gratings;distributed Bragg reflectors;dyes;gas sensors;integrated optics;laser modes;microcavity lasers;optical sensors;remote sensing by laser beam;semiconductor lasers;silicon compounds;spectrochemical analysis;surface emitting lasers","high-contrast grating feedback;gas detection;highly integrated optical sensing techniques;active micropillar design;distributed Bragg reflectors;high contrast grating thin layer;confinement factor;laser spectral line;gas concentration;vertical architecture;microlaser-based sensor;ultracompact organic vertical-cavity microlaser;organic Rhodamine 6G doped SiO2 gain layer;wavelength-interrogation sensing architecture;full-wave electromagnetic simulations;highly integrated remote gas sensing;SiO2","","1","","37","IEEE","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
