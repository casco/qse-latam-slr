Void-free conformal coating of up to 500 μm-deep and 50 μm-wide vias with a mere 2 μm-thick layer of Al, a widely available metal in for IC manufacturing, was demonstrated. Single-via electric resistance as low as 468 mΩ at room temperature and superconductivity at 1.25 K were measured by a cross-bridge Kelvin resistor structure. This work establishes the fabrication of functional superconducting interposers suitable for 3D integration of high-density silicon-based quantum computing architectures.","2160-1968","978-1-7281-3581-6","10.1109/MEMS46641.2020.9056165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056165","Through-silicon vias;superconducting;quantum","","aluminium;CMOS integrated circuits;conformal coatings;elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit manufacture;silicon;sputtered coatings;superconducting integrated circuits;three-dimensional integrated circuits;vias","superconducting interposers;high-density silicon-based quantum computing architectures;cross-bridge Kelvin resistor structure;superconductivity;single-via electric resistance;IC manufacturing;void-free conformal coating;CMOS-compatible 3D interconnects;DC-sputtered Aluminum;high-aspect ratio through-silicon vias;first-time wafer-scale arrays;specifically tailored sidewall profile;microfabrication process;quantum 3D integration;high-aspect ratio TSVS;Al","","3","","15","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the first-time pure indium, a type-I superconductor metal, is used to fill HAR vias, 300 to 500 μm in depth and 50 to 100 μm in diameter. The low electrical resistivity achieved without sintering, its reproducibility and straightforward processing steps, and the short time required to fill large arrays of vias at wafer scale - all make this method one of the simplest and quickest options for filling HAR TSVs for MEMS 3D integration. Moreover, the low melting point (~ 150 °C), malleability and superconductivity at 3.41 K make indium an interesting option in 3D interconnects for connecting quantum devices operating below 4 K.","2160-1968","978-1-5386-4782-0","10.1109/MEMSYS.2018.8346611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8346611","","Through-silicon vias;Filling;Surface treatment;Blades;Superconductivity;Indium","electrical resistivity;indium;integrated circuit interconnections;liquid metals;melting point;micromechanical devices;superconducting materials;three-dimensional integrated circuits;voids (solid)","superconductive material;void-free filling;high aspect ratio;through-silicon-vias;first-time pure indium;electrical resistivity;HAR TSV;melting point;VALM TSV filling method;vacuum assisted liquified metal;MEMS 3D integration;type-I superconductor metal;3D interconnects;quantum devices;temperature 3.41 K;temperature 4.0 K;size 300 mum to 500 mum;size 50 mum to 100 mum;In","","4","","10","IEEE","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
