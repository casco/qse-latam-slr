The goal of this paper is to discuss nonfunctional requirements for quantum programs. Based on experiences developing quantum software for real quantum hardware we analyze hardware-related constraints and derive a set of generic nonfunctional requirements for this type of program. We identified a set of five performance efficiency and reliability related non-functional requirements that should considered when implementing a quantum program for a quantum device. We also discuss available solution options to address the requirements. There are high level solutions to deal with the hardware-related constraints described in our identified requirements. While many of the them are specific to quantum programming languages and technologies, the scientific community is engaging to integrate these kind of solutions into the quantum software engineering life cycle in an agnostic way regarding quantum programming languages and technologies. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Non-functional requirements; Quantum software engineering","Efficiency; Life cycle; Software engineering; Efficiency and reliability; Efficiency improvement; Non-functional requirements; Performance efficiency; Performance reliability; Programming technology; Quantum Computing; Quantum device; Quantum programming languages; Quantum software engineering; Quantum computers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120619613"

The tool was developed at SENAI Institute of Innovation for Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate adherence to Takt PM, offering processes systematization and using best practices suggested by the methodology. The tool supports (1) project planning using a service package diagram called Handoff Network, (2) project monitoring through Kanban and Kanban Quantum boards, (3) automatic Gantt generation and update, according to the project Handoff Network and service packages deliveries, (4) monitoring teams through the observation of a unified board that demonstrates the allocation of the team with the activities that are running or waiting to be performed, (5) automatic allocation of service packages to the teams considering the limit of in progress activities of the team configured to the organization, implementing the pull system, (6) status report of service package delivery and project progress, in a non-declarative way with evidences, and (7) visualization of the project timeline showing the transaction history that includes the project start, service packages deliveries, and service packages rejections that were performed during the project. We used an MVC software architecture to implement the solution, composed by front-end in Vue.js, an API following the REST standard in .Net core, and a SQL Server database. Also, the tool was integrated with the SENAI Technology Management System (a particular ERP system). All modules developed were dockerized and deployed on AWS machines. To access the tool, sign up on https://pahpum.isitics.com, and the administrators will approve the access. We are currently evaluating the tool through a qualitative study to understand the positive and negative impacts through the tool's adoption during the execution of real projects. © 2020 ACM.","Agile methodologies; Project management; Project planning; Software development; Takt PM","Enterprise resource planning; Software engineering; Automatic allocation; Information and Communication Technologies; Project management methodology; Project management tools; Project monitoring; Qualitative study; Technology managements; Transaction history; Project management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099347074"
