"Quantum Computing for Undergraduate Engineering Students: Report of an Experience","L. Gatti; R.

Students’ levels varied from year two to five of their careers and had previous knowledge on Calculus, Linear Algebra and Programming, but not on Quantum Mechanics or on Modern Physics. The main objective of the course was that students acquire programming skills in Quantum Computing, so it had a practical approach. Instead of beginning by introducing the physical phenomenology under the field, the course started directly with presenting the logic of quantum computing from an abstract point of view. The language used was Q#. The curricula was based on the one available for the Microsoft Quantum Network.","","978-1-6654-1691-7","10.1109/QCE52317.2021.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605347","Quantum Computing;Education;Quantum Workforce;Undergraduate Engineering Education","Three-dimensional displays;Engineering profession;Quantum mechanics;Virtual environments;Linear algebra;Calculus;Quantum networks","computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;quantum computing;specification languages;teaching","quantum computing;undergraduate engineering students;quantum mechanics;Microsoft Quantum Network;quantum computer course;Q# language","","2","","17","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though the postulates of quantum mechanics guarantee any unitary operation as a feasible operation over a quantum system, there is no simple method to implement an arbitrary algorithm. By means of a multilayer hybrid neural network in which the basic cell is made up of CNOTs and universal one-qubit unitary gates, this work offers a solution to the given problem. These specific gates were chosen since they are the gates available in real quantum computers such as IBMQ's quantum processors. The network learns the unitary gates classically using the method of the steepest descent and is aided in learning the entangling gates by the use of two types of quantum correlations: Mutual Information (MI) and Cumulative Correlation Measure (CCM). The algorithm implemented in this case is a type of supervised learning. The results show that the model fits the data gracefully and correctly predicts a wide range of algorithms.","","978-1-6654-2443-1","10.1109/URUCON53396.2021.9647233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9647233","","Training;Knowledge engineering;Quantum system;Correlation;Neural networks;Supervised learning;Machine learning","learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;quantum computing;quantum entanglement;quantum gates;quantum theory","quantum circuit design;neural networks;universal quantum circuits;classical machine;quantum problem;generic quantum operator;elementary unitary matrices;universal basic quantum gates;quantum mechanics;unitary operation;feasible operation;quantum system;arbitrary algorithm;multilayer hybrid neural network;basic cell;one-qubit unitary gates;specific gates;quantum computers;IBMQ's quantum processors;entangling gates;quantum correlations;supervised learning","","","","14","IEEE","27 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combinatorial optimization problems are computationally complex in conventional computing. The origins of Quantum Computing date back to the early 90's. This discipline allows solving problems that in conventional computing are complex [1]. We present a Quantum Computing tool, the QUBO method (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) [2], which is suitable for formulating combinatorial optimization problems. QUBO is a recently developed tool, based on Quantum Annealing and is implemented in some current quantum computers. It consists of minimizing outputs of the type xTQx with x being a binary decision vector and Q a square or triangular matrix with constant parameters provided by the model. Restrictions can be added to the treated system. These problems have to do with making good decisions in environments where a large number of binary decisions (Yes/No) must be made and each set of decisions produces a corresponding objective function value, such as a cost or benefit value. In the video we also present the example of the Number Partitioning Problem.","","978-1-7281-5957-7","10.1109/ARGENCON49523.2020.9505401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505401","","Computers;Airplanes;Quantum computing;Computational modeling;Boats;Tools;Containers","aircraft;boats;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;freight handling;logistics;optimisation;quadratic programming;quantum computing","combinatorial optimization problems;quantum annealing;quantum computers;binary decision vector;number partitioning problem;quantum optimization techniques;ships;airplanes;cargo logistics;barges;quantum computing;Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization method;QUBO method","","1","","2","IEEE","13 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All windings are at nearly ground potential during laboratory calibration because this is the typical configuration for almost all CT's calibration systems. However, in service, the primary winding is at high potential, so that additional currents flow through the load due to stray capacitances between primary and secondary windings, even if the CT has an electrostatic shield for reducing these capacitances. This effect changes the CT errors determined at no potential. Experimental determination of the variation of ratio and phase displacement errors between both working conditions is evaluated for a set of different CTs using different measuring systems. These systems include from the simplest low-voltage bridge capacitance measurement to the most complex one that simultaneously applies current and voltage.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2015.2393395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029639","Current transformer (CT);high voltage (HV);instrument transformer;isolation;parasitic capacitance;test.;Current transformer (CT);high voltage (HV);instrument transformer;isolation;parasitic capacitance;test","Windings;Current measurement;Capacitance;Voltage measurement;Standards;Bridge circuits;Measurement uncertainty","calibration;capacitance measurement;current transformers;electrostatics;transformer windings","stray capacitance measurement;high-voltage current transformer;secondary winding;primary winding;CT;high-voltage power network;calibration;electrostatic shield;phase displacement error;low-voltage bridge capacitance measurement","","10","","13","IEEE","3 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To develop a multidimensional lesion warning device, several variables must be considered, among which vascular parameters. To minimize the number of sensors, we investigate the use of standard flexible force sensing resistors (FSRs), FSR402 and FSR406, to detect not only plantar pressure but also bioimpedance plethysmography. Since FSRs include conductive electrodes covered by polymer film, the interface with the subject can be considered a capacitive electrode. We present a special impedance plethysmography (IPG) circuit to inject current using FSRs and measuring the resulting voltage from other FSRs contacts. IPG simulations with two modeled FSRs, two contacts each, were not successful, but using four FSRs, one capacitive contact each, shows a precision within 4% of the expected FSR resistor value. The IPG system was verified with simultaneously matching ECG-lead I, Ag–AgCl, and capacitive electrode signals alongside power spectra. For the first time, four sole pressure sensors are used also as bioimpedance electrodes to detect cardiac activity with standard components at frequencies up to 50 kHz and simulated as well as experimentally verified on one healthy subject.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3178961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785883","Bioimpedance;diabetic foot ulcer (DFU);force sensing resistor (FSR);impedance plethysmography (IPG);plantar electrodes;wearable device","Bioimpedance;Resistors;Foot;Electrodes;Sensors;Force;Impedance","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electrodes;diseases;electrocardiography;force sensors;plethysmography;polymer films;pressure measurement;pressure sensors;resistors","plantar impedance plethysmography electrodes;diabetic foot ulcers;multidimensional lesion warning device;vascular parameters;standard flexible force sensing resistors;FSR402;FSR406;plantar pressure;bioimpedance plethysmography;conductive electrodes;IPG simulations;modeled FSRs;capacitive contact;IPG system;capacitive electrode signals;sole pressure sensors;bioimpedance electrodes;impedance plethysmography circuit;FSR contacts;FSR resistor value;polymer film;ECG-lead I;power spectra;cardiac activity","","4","","29","IEEE","31 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
