The temperature distribution in the structures is obtained by solving the heat conduction equation using the Finite Element Method and a two-dimensional heat-flow model. In calculation, the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity due to the phonon scattering at the interfaces was considered. The thermal resistance was calculated and compared with experimental data reported by other authors, obtaining a very good agreement. A comparison of the heat dissipation in QCLs structures with the same active region, but having different waveguides: standard ridge, buried and double channel was performed. The influence of design parameters such as the depth and width of the ridge contact on the active region temperature is analyzed. The effect of the material used as heat sink was also evaluated.","","978-1-4673-7839-0","10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357812","Quantum cascade laser;Thermal analysis;Heat conduction;Computer modeling and simulation","Quantum cascade lasers;Thermal conductivity;Heating;Conductivity;Heat sinks;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials","aluminium compounds;cooling;finite element analysis;gallium compounds;heat sinks;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;optical waveguides;quantum cascade lasers;ridge waveguides;temperature distribution;thermal conductivity;thermal resistance","heat sink;active region temperature;ridge contact;double channel;buried channel;optical waveguides;heat dissipation;thermal resistance;phonon scattering;thermal conductivity anisotropy;two-dimensional heat flow model;finite element method;heat conduction equation;temperature distribution;thermal properties;ridge geometry effect;GaInAs-AlInAs quantum cascade lasers;GaInAs-AlInAs","","","","13","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
