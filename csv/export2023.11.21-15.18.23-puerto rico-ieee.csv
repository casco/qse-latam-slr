For example, the role of large generating units in the presence of renewable energy needs to be reexamined, especially in places with good renewable resources and aggressive energy policies. This paper presents lessons learned from the preparation, coordination and delivery of a short course on reporting electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity. The short course addressed specific industry needs, and was arranged under the leadership of the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez. Besides discussing the use of IEEE Standard 762, the course also covered ways to consider variable generation in the future. Puerto Rico's current and proposed renewable energy use was the primary context for the discussion. Assessment results demonstrated that the short course achieved its objectives.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190568","Workforce development;industry-university collaborations;electric generating unit;renewable energy","Industries;Collaboration;Renewable energy sources;Power systems;Continuing education;IEEE Standards;Reliability","educational courses;government policies;IEEE standards;power engineering education;power generation reliability;renewable energy sources","IEEE Standard 762;industry-university collaboration;workforce development;electric generating unit reliability;renewable resources;energy policies;renewable energy","","1","","16","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
