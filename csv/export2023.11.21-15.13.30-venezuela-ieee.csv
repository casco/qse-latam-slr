"Development of a methodology for studying the bending angle of head and neck","S. L. Linares; L. A.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology to study the flexion angle of the head and neck, evaluating different positions respect to the spine, starting from a standing position (looking forward) to the maximum flexion angle, through a motion analysis system, to be applied in future studies to determinate the maximum flexion angle anatomically allowed to use a cell phone. This movement was made in four cases, from the subject standing up to the subject seated. It was possible to propose a methodology that encompasses both the selection and placement of markers in head and neck, that allows the calculation of the muscle forces and moments and the joint moments, using inverse kinematics and dynamics applied to a musculoskeletal model for each case with specialized open source software (OpenSim).","2327-817X","978-1-4673-6257-3","10.1109/PAHCE.2013.6568234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568234","Angle of the head and neck;cervical spine;flexion;motion analysis","Medical services;Conferences;Couplings;IEEE catalog;Decision support systems;Quantum well devices","bending;biomechanics;bone;kinematics;medical computing;mobile computing;muscle;orthopaedics;public domain software","methodology development;head-neck bending angle;cell phones;neck pain;headache;shoulder pain;cervical spine;posture;head-neck flexion angle;maximum flexion angle;motion analysis system;muscle forces;joint moments;inverse kinematics;musculoskeletal model;open source software","","","","11","IEEE","25 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
