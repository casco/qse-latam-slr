"Encrypted Communications Through Quantum Key Distributions Algorithms and Bessel Functions","H.

The concept of sending encrypted information based in the BB84 is used in this paper where basically we implement the algorithm by using an orthogonal basis consisting in integer-order Bessel functions. In this paper we present a model of communications based in the BB84 protocol and Bessel functions. We follow the concept of sender and receiver without any eavesdropper by guaranteeing the full confidence of the exchange of information. However we introduce an inherent error to the action of communication that might be realizable in concrete scenarios of wireless communications.","","978-1-5386-5491-0","10.1109/INTERCON.2018.8526443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8526443","","Quantum mechanics;Protocols;Cryptography;Photonics;Internet of Things;Probability","Bessel functions;quantum cryptography","quantum key distributions algorithms;Bessel functions;Bennett-Brassard algorithm;encrypted communications;Quantum Mechanics;BB84 protocol;wireless communications;integer-order Bessel functions","","4","","13","IEEE","8 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising alternative to this problem. Due to its spin properties, easy manipulation, and the possibility of doing optical state initialization and readout, it quickly became one of the best solid-state spin systems for QIP at room temperature. Here, we present the characterization of the spin-coherence of an ensemble of NV centers in an engineered sample of ultrapure diamond as a testbed for quantum protocols for quantum metrology.","","978-1-6654-1948-2","10.1109/SBFotonIOPC50774.2021.9461941","CAPES; CNPq; FAPESP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461941","Nitrogen-vacancy centers;quantum diamond;quantum sensor;solid-state spin system","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Protocols;Temperature;Optical variables measurement;Metrology;Diamond","diamond;optical pumping;optical sensors;quantum optics;spin systems;vacancies (crystal)","spin-coherence measurements;quantum metrology;nitrogen-vacancy centers;diamond-based quantum sensors;NV centers;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;C","","1","","13","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing & secure data sharing have emerged as new technologies, owing to current advances in machine learning. Conventional machine learning algorithms need the collection & processing of training information on centralized systems. With the introduction of new decentralized machine learning algorithms & cloud computing, ML on-device information learning is now a reality. IoT gadgets may outsource training duties to cloud computing services to enable AI at the network’s perimeter. Furthermore, these dispersed edges intelligence architectures bring additional issues, also including consumer confidentiality & information safety. Blockchain has been proposed as a viable alternative to these issues. Blockchain, as a dispersed intelligent database, has evolved as a revolutionary innovation for the future phase of multiple industries’ uses due to its decentralized, accessible, & safe structure. This system also includes trustworthy automatic scripting running & unchangeable information recordings. As quantum technologies have proven more viable in the latest days, blockchain has faced prospective challenges from quantum computations.

Such a model encapsulates the structure of state-of-the-art algorithms, yet it presents a considerably faster alternative which adapts to input examples without a priori statistical information. Simulations on natural and synthetic datasets show accurate reconstructions with structural similarities consistent with the state of the art, while requiring approximately 5 times less computational cost.","2381-8549","978-1-5090-2175-8","10.1109/ICIP.2017.8296791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8296791","Image reconstruction;quanta image sensors;error backpropagation;MLE;Anscombe transform","Image reconstruction;Reconstruction algorithms;Maximum likelihood estimation;Cost function;Transforms;Training;Sensors","backpropagation;image reconstruction;image sensors;neural nets","binary sensing image reconstruction algorithms;quantum image sensors;error backpropagation;neural network","","5","","20","IEEE","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With an expanding number of fierce competitors inside the industry, important banks place a premium on client relationship management. A detailed and real-time credit card holder churn review is critical and helpful for bankers looking to retain credit cards. According to extensive research, maintaining an existing client is more than five times simpler than acquiring a new one. As a result, this research provides a strategy for predicting churns using a bank dataset. The ""Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique"" (SMOTE) was employed in this study to handle the unbalanced dataset. Randome forest, K closest neighbour, and two boosting algorithms, XgBoost and CatBoost, are used to forecast credit card user turnover. To improve accuracy, hyperparameter tweaking using grid search was performed. The testing results demonstrate that Catboost has an accuracy of 97.85 percent and outperforms the other models.","","978-1-6654-7413-9","10.1109/ICSES55317.2022.9914238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9914238","Machine Learning;Churn Prediction;SMOTE;Banking Industry;Random forest Classifier;Catboost","Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Insurance;Forestry;Credit cards;Prediction algorithms;Boosting;Real-time systems;Telecommunications;Testing","bank data processing;credit transactions;customer relationship management;learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods","real-time credit card holder churn review;bank dataset;synthetic minority oversampling technique;unbalanced dataset;credit card user turnover;credit card customer action;consumer switches;service provider;client relationship management;XgBoost;CatBoost","","","","13","IEEE","14 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
