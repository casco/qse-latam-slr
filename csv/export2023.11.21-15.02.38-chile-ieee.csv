We achieve a coincidence window as narrow as 500 ps with a series of optimizations on a readily-available and affordable FPGA development board. Our implementation allows real-time visualization of coincidence measurements for multiple coincidence window widths simultaneously. To demonstrate the advantage of our high-resolution visualization, we certified the generation of polarized entangled photons by collecting data from multiple coincidence windows with minimal accidental counts, obtaining a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality by more than 338 standard deviations. Our results have shown the applicability of our electronic design in the field of quantum information.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093371","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT)(grant numbers:11201348,1190901,1180995,1200859,3210359); ANID Millennium Science Initiative Program(grant numbers:ICN17012); ANID/REC/PAI77190088; Ceniit Linköping University, the Swedish Research Council(grant numbers:VR 2017-04470); QuantERA grant SECRET(grant numbers:VR grant no. 2019-00392); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467345","Field-programmable gate arrays;quantum information;coincidence counting","Field programmable gate arrays;Delays;Photonics;Image edge detection;Detectors;Clocks;Logic gates","Bell theorem;field programmable gate arrays;light polarisation;optical windows;photodetectors;quantum entanglement;quantum optics","high-resolution visualization;polarized entangled photons;quantum information;quantum optics experiments;electronic coincidence detection circuit;quantum photonic applications;field-programmable gate array;time separation;detection events;single-photon detectors;FPGA development board;multiple coincidence window widths;Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality;CHSH Bell inequality;time 500.0 ps","","","","32","CCBY","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Scalability down to atomic dimensions, operation in the GHz-to-THz frequency range, utilization of nonlinear and nonreciprocal phenomena, and compatibility with CMOS are just a few of many advantages offered by magnons. Although magnonics is still primarily positioned in the academic domain, the scientific and technological challenges of the field are being extensively investigated, and many proof-of-concept prototypes have already been realized in laboratories. This roadmap is a product of the collective work of many authors, which covers versatile spin-wave computing approaches, conceptual building blocks, and underlying physical phenomena. In particular, the roadmap discusses the computation operations with the Boolean digital data, unconventional approaches, such as neuromorphic computing, and the progress toward magnon-based quantum computing. This article is organized as a collection of sub-sections grouped into seven large thematic sections. Each sub-section is prepared by one or a group of authors and concludes with a brief description of current challenges and the outlook of further development for each research direction.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2022.3149664","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:18F18015,JP19H05600, JP20H02599, and JP21H04643); S.

Classical non-interferometric pulse characterization techniques such as FROG have been using iterative reconstruction algorithms for decades [1]. Convergence tests have been conducted, memetic algorithms have been used, and even deep neural network techniques have been applied. More recent non-interferometric pulse measurement techniques, such as dispersion-scan (d-scan), also use iterative reconstruction algorithms [2]. In order to approach the problems associated with convergence in non-interferometric techniques, this work presents a fully non-interferometric pulse characterization technique that reconstructs amplitudes and phases of two input pulses, from two different FROG spectrograms using a direct reconstruction algorithm [3]. This direct and analytical algorithm is evidently very fast and completely bypasses the convergence issue, thus presenting a significant difference to conventional FROG, d-scan and other non-interferometric techniques. The two different FROG spectrograms are measured with a single-shot FROG setup. To demonstrate and determine the reconstruction quality for complex pulses, a programmable pulse shaper is used to modify the pulses sourced from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator.","2833-1052","979-8-3503-4599-5","10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC57999.2023.10232329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10232329","","Memetics;Optical interferometry;Optical pulse shaping;Pulse measurements;Reconstruction algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Optical pulse generation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);iterative methods;laser mode locking;laser pulses;laser variables measurement;light interferometry;optical Kerr effect;optical pulse shaping;physics computing;pulse measurement;sapphire;solid lasers;titanium","Al2O3:Ti/ss;convergence tests;deep neural network techniques;direct reconstruction algorithm;dispersion-scan;FROG spectrograms;fully noninterferometric pulse characterization technique;input pulses;interferometric pulse measurement techniques;iterative reconstruction algorithms;Kerr-lens mode-locked titanium:sapphire oscillator;memetic algorithms;noninterferometric frequency-resolved optical gating;programmable pulse shaper;ultrashort pulses","","","","4","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus on the main mechanisms of vortex generation in liquid crystals, in particular on vortex generation induced by umbilics, that is, defects arising in homeotropically aligned nematic cells, which act as topological matter templates able to realize the conversion from spin to orbital angular momentum of an incoming Gaussian beam [2-3]. Optical vortex induction in a photosensitive light valve is presented as a self-stabilizing mechanism leading to reconfigurable and programmable vortex arrays. On each lattice site, every matter vortex acts as a photonic spin-to-orbital momentum coupler, converting input arrays of circularly polarized beams into output arrays of vortex beams with topological charges consistent with the matter lattice symmetry.","","978-1-5090-6736-7","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8087536","","Optical vortices;Liquid crystals;Lattices;Media;Photonics;Liquid crystal devices;Biomedical optical imaging","angular momentum;light polarisation;nematic liquid crystals;optical couplers;optical materials;optical vortices","CLEO-Europe-EQEC 2017;optical vortex induction;self-stabilizing mechanism;circularly polarized beams;vortex beams;topological charges;bio-inspired devices;enhanced imaging systems;optical processing;matter lattice symmetry;photonic spin-to-orbital momentum coupler;programmable vortex arrays;reconfigurable vortex arrays;photosensitive light valve;incoming Gaussian beam;orbital angular momentum;topological matter;homeotropically aligned nematic cells;vortex generation;liquid-crystal media;light-matter interaction;optical vortices","","","","3","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PDs are used to characterize the evolution of progressive defects such as electrical trees, considered one of the main mechanisms of degradation in polymeric insulation, that leads to failure. In this work, a new methodology for the identification of the aging stage of electrical trees is proposed, based on the measurement and analysis of each PD pulse waveform by means of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA). A total of 24 treeing samples of epoxy resin were analyzed and tested under ac voltages of 10, 12, and 14 kV with frequencies of 50–550 Hz. The results showed that it is possible to characterize the development of electrical trees into three stages: initial, valley, and postcrossing, showing different behaviors in terms of discharge and tree structure. It was found that PD can be classified into two groups, in which one group (“Group (b)”) served as an identifier of the postcrossing stage, and therefore an alert of the imminent insulation failure. Regarding the structure of trees, it was observed that growth in the valley stage can be associated with the development of filamentary branches with low PD activity, while growth in the postcrossing stage can be associated with the development of dark branches with higher PD activity. In some cases, reverse trees grew in this last stage. Additionally, it was observed that using the methodology proposed, the development of dark branches was associated with the appearance of Group (b) PD. The ability of the presented measurement and evaluation technique to identify growth-stage of electrical trees at different applied voltages and frequencies shows its potential for the implementation of insulation assessment of real power equipment in service, such as power cables.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3284922","Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) through the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT)(grant numbers:11181177); Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María; Programa de Incentivos a la Iniciación Científica (PIIC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10147909","Diagnostics;electrical trees;insulation systems;partial discharges;principal component analysis;wavelet transform","Discrete wavelet transforms;Principal component analysis;Frequency measurement;Insulation;Discharges (electric);Voltage measurement;Pulse measurements","ageing;discrete wavelet transforms;epoxy insulation;insulation testing;partial discharge measurement;power apparatus;power cable insulation;principal component analysis;resins;trees (electrical)","AC voltages;discharge;discrete wavelet transform;DWT;electrical tree growth identification;epoxy resin;frequency 50.0 Hz to 550.0 Hz;insulation failure;insulation systems;low PD activity;PCA;polymeric insulation;postcrossing stage;power electrical equipment;principal component analysis;tree structure;voltage 10.0 kV;voltage 12.0 kV;voltage 14.0 kV","","","","32","IEEE","9 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Normally, a failure in the material under these conditions does not occur immediately, but over time, different degradation processes emerge and evolve, progressively deteriorating the insulation, until breakdown occurs, and consequently, the asset finishes its operation with a catastrophic failure. In this context, partial discharge (PD) measurement can be considered as one of the best indicators when diagnosing the status of much electrical equipment in operation. However, the simultaneous presence of noise sources or multiple PD sources can generate important difficulties in identifying the type or types of sources measured. These practical limitations can be solved if, prior to the identification, a separation process is carried out, which allows classifying the different sources acting over the equipment being monitored. Once the sources separation is executed, the subsequent identification and diagnosis process can be carried out more easily. In this article, we present a novel separation technique based on the temporal and spectral behavior of the PD signals. For this technique, the separation of sources is carried out through three different parameters. Two of them are based on the peakedness of PD signals and electrical noise, and the third parameter is associated with their spectral content. Based on these parameters, a 3-D separation map is established, representing in clusters each source captured by the sensors.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3121488","Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)(grant numbers:1200055); Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico(grant numbers:ID19I10165); Federico Santa Maria Technical University (UTFSM)(grant numbers:PI_m_19_01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580910","Clustering;electrical noise;kurtosis;monopole antenna;partial discharge (PD);separation map;skewness","Partial discharges;Histograms;Three-dimensional displays;Separation processes;Corona;Noise measurement;Monitoring","ageing;cable insulation;electric machines;partial discharge measurement;partial discharges","cables;electrical noise;PD signals;spectral behavior;temporal behavior;sources separation;noise sources;electrical equipment;partial discharge measurement;catastrophic failure;environmental aging;thermal aging;mechanical aging;electrical aging;electrical machines;insulation systems","","6","","28","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, concerns arise as many of these assets have surpassed their useful life or are nearing the end of it. For this reason, the monitoring and diagnosis of failures in liquid insulation systems play an important role when it comes to extending the life of these pieces of equipment. In its current state, the measurement systems used to capture and quantify the evolution of gases have limitations hindering their widespread use in routine measurements. These limitations have forced a large part of the research and development efforts to focus on developing and proposing new forms of measurement that can be applied without any type of technical-economic restriction and still provide a much more accurate diagnosis of the failure. This article introduces a novel system that utilizes an electronic nose (E-nose) equipped with eight metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)-type gas sensors to measure dissolved gases in liquid insulation systems. The obtained results validate the system’s exceptional performance in differentiating mineral oil samples based on the type and concentration of the predominant gases. This innovative approach shows great promise for routine monitoring and diagnosis, offering an efficient and cost-effective solution.

Ensemble empirical mode decomposition with canonical correlation analysis (EEMD-CCA) has been proven to be an efficient method for denoising of EEG contaminated with muscle artifacts. EEMD-CCA, likewise the majority of algorithms, does not incorporate any statistical information of the artifact, namely, electromyogram (EMG) recorded over the muscles actively contaminating the EEG. In this paper, we propose to extend EEMD-CCA in order to include an EMG array as information to aid the removal of artifacts, assessing the performance gain achieved when the number of EMG channels grow. By filtering adaptively (recursive least squares, EMG array as reference) each component resulting from CCA, we aim to ameliorate the distortion of brain signals induced by artifacts and denoising methods. We simulated several noise scenarios based on a linear contamination model, between real and synthetic EEG and EMG signals, and varied the number of EMG channels available to the filter. Our results exhibit a substantial improvement in the performance as the number of EMG electrodes increase from 2 to 16. Further increasing the number of EMG channels up to 128 did not have a significant impact on the performance. We conclude by recommending the use of EMG electrodes to filter components, as it is a computationally inexpensive enhancement that impacts significantly on performance using only a few electrodes.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2019.2906967","Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica(grant numbers:FONDECYT 1151077,BASAL FB0008,ANILLO ACT172121); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(grant numbers:P50DC015446); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8704181","Adaptive filtering;artifact removal;blind-source-separation;electroencephalogram (EEG);electromyogram (EMG);muscle artifacts","Electroencephalography;Muscles;Electromyography;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Correlation;Contamination","biomedical electrodes;electroencephalography;electromyography;filtering theory;Hilbert transforms;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal denoising","denoising methods;linear contamination model;EMG signals;EMG channels;EMG electrodes;EMG array;muscle activity;ensemble empirical mode decomposition;canonical correlation analysis;EEMD-CCA;statistical information;EEG muscle artifact removal;electroencephalogram;electromyogram;brain signals;recursive least squares","","27","","30","IEEE","1 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An electrical detection method has been considered with PD pulses measured at the top and bottom of the winding through high-frequency current transformers (HFCTs). To reveal multiscale intrinsic characteristics of the PD signal, authors extracted intrinsic mode function (IMF) using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Next, the instantaneous energy distribution-permutation entropy (PE-IED) values of the first several IMFs were calculated to capture the energy of the PD. Then, dimensionality reduction was ensured by the fast principal component analysis that uses the fixed-point algorithm method. Finally, adaptive density-based clustering using the nearest neighbor graph (ADBSCAN-NNG) approach is proposed to identify the local high-density energy components. The proposed method is verified using the winding of a vacuum cast coil transformer and the localization results reveal the feasibility of the proposed method in locating PDs over existing localization algorithms. The reduced complexity of the proposed algorithm ensures the accurate onsite PD localization in transformer windings.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3121477","Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)(grant numbers:1200055,Fondef ID19I10165); Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM)(grant numbers:PI_m_19_01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580914","Fast principal component analysis (PCA);location identification;partial discharge (PD);permutation entropy (PE) based energy distribution;transformer winding","Partial discharges;Windings;Clustering algorithms;Location awareness;Current transformers;Current measurement;Principal component analysis","current transformers;entropy;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;partial discharge measurement;partial discharges;pattern clustering;power transformers;principal component analysis;signal denoising;transformer windings","fixed-point algorithm method;adaptive density-based;nearest neighbor graph approach;local high-density energy components;winding;vacuum cast coil transformer;localization algorithms;accurate onsite PD localization;transformer windings;partial discharge location identification;instantaneous energy features;reliable technique;necessary technique;impending failure;different PD sources;diverse impacts;unique energy characteristics;PD signal;electrical detection method;PD pulses;high-frequency current transformers;multiscale intrinsic characteristics;intrinsic mode function;IMF;ensemble empirical mode decomposition;instantaneous energy distribution-permutation entropy values;fast principal component analysis","","5","","31","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
