Towards the massive deployment of QKD, embedding it with the telecommunication system is crucially important. Homogenous optical multi-core fibers (MCFs) compatible with spatial division multiplexing (SDM) are essential components for the next-generation optical communication infrastructure, which provides a big potential for co-existence of optical telecommunication systems and QKD. However, the QKD channel is extremely vulnerable due to the fact that the quantum states can be annihilated by noise during signal propagation. Thus, investigation of telecom compatibility for QKD co-existing with high-speed classical communication in SDM transmission media is needed. In this paper, we present analytical models of the noise sources in QKD links over heterogeneous MCFs. Spontaneous Raman scattering and inter-core crosstalk are experimentally characterized over spans of MCFs with different refractive index profiles, emulating shared telecom traffic conditions. Lower bounds for the secret key rates and quantum bit error rate (QBER) due to different core/wavelength allocation are obtained to validate intra- and inter-core co-existence of QKD and classical telecommunication.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990186","Ceniit–Linköping University, Swedish Research Council; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF); Göran Gustafsson Foundation; Celtic-Plus sub-project SENDATE-EXTEND funded by Vinnova; EU H2020 project TWILIGHT(grant numbers:871741); Vinnova funded project Centre for Software-Defined Optical Networks; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61722108); H2020 NEWMAN Project(grant numbers:752826); AoA ICT seed project and Genie project funded by Chalmers University of Technology Foundation; Tektronix for equipment loan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078126","Quantum key distribution;spatial division multiplexing;telecommunications;communication system security","Photonics;Resource management;Telecommunications;Multiplexing;Optical fiber networks;Media","data communication;error statistics;next generation networks;optical crosstalk;optical fibre networks;private key cryptography;quantum cryptography;quantum theory;Raman spectra;space division multiplexing","refractive index profiles;telecom traffic conditions;core-wavelength allocation;spontaneous Raman scattering;high-speed classical communication;signal propagation;spatial division multiplexing;telecommunication compatibility;heterogeneous MCF;inter-core co-existence;quantum bit error rate;secret key rates;inter-core crosstalk;QKD links;SDM transmission media;high-speed classical communication;telecom compatibility;quantum states;QKD channel;optical telecommunication systems;next-generation optical communication infrastructure;multicore fibers;computational complexity;quantum mechanics;data communication;homogenous multicore fiber;quantum key distribution","","8","","38","CCBY","24 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MRFO and its applications have the task of finding the optimal controller variable values to control the system's temperature and pressure. The MRFO is a metaheuristic based on the behavior of manta rays, and although it shows efficient performance it may be improved through the use of techniques which generate new variants of the algorithm. Two techniques were used in the de-velopment of new variants: Quantum mechanics and opposition-based learning. The three different versions of MRFO were used to minimize a custom fitness function which is a combination of the integral time squared error (ITSE) and the overshoot of the system response. Simulations were carried using Simulink and Matlab softwares. For analyzing the performances, statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, best, mean, median, and standard deviation of the fitness function over 50 runs were used. Additionally, the different variants were also compared for minimizing 10 benchmark functions. The results show that the use of the previously mentioned techniques improve the performance of the original MRFO in optimizing the FOPID to control the ball mill pulverizing system.","","979-8-3503-1458-8","10.1109/CEC53210.2023.10254147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254147","Proportional- Integral- Derivative Control;Manta Ray Foraging Optimization;Oppositional-Based Learning;Quantum Mechanics;Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Application","Software packages;Metaheuristics;Quantum mechanics;Temperature control;PD control;Task analysis;Tuning;Standards;MIMO communication;Matlab","artificial bee colony algorithm;control system synthesis;metaheuristics;optimal control;optimisation;three-term control","ball mill pulverizing system;best deviation;custom fitness function;decentralized fractional order proportional-integral-derivative;fuel efficiency;integral time;Manta Ray Foraging Optimization approaches;manta rays;maximum deviation;mean deviation;median, deviation;mentioned techniques;minimum deviation;multiple-input multiple-output application;multivariable PID controller;newly developed Manta Ray Foraging Optimization;opposition;optimal controller variable values;original MRFO;standard deviation;system response","","","","30","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The SPR and SBC combination is ideal for advances in direction of miniaturization and portability, however many scientific and engineering solutions yet required a computer connection for operation, and reported portable sensors in which hardware and software resources are misused. Here a standalone portable SPR based on an SBC is presented. The sensor operates without the need for another device, computer, or connection. Designed to work with thicker (3 mm thick) or thin (1.5 mm) biochips to support surface plasmons (SPs) and avoid rotational parts, a set of special structures was designed to encapsulate all electronics and optical elements. Composed of modular parts manufactured in a 3-D printer, the proposed arrangement enables quick maintenance and repair actions, eventually required for field applications. The chassis piece enclosure the components and fit the touchscreen. A replaced top cover piece enables the exchange of the thicker- and thin- biochips. And a back lid gives access to the internal components, where moving parts are designed and included to improve mechanical alignment. The sensor was optimized to Raspberry Pi SBC. The Python-based embedded software implements algorithms for acquiring, processing, displaying, storing, and delivering the SPR responses. To demonstrate the solution feasibility a Raspberry pi 3 model B was used. The well knows biochips PPBIO (Prism BIOchip) (thicker) and diffractive optical coupling element (DOCE) (thin) were attached to the proposed SBC-SPR Sensor. Those biochips dismissed index-matching gels and rotate parts, which benefits the sensing labor cost. Experiments of aqueous solutions were performed with a sensor operating in the so-called angular interrogation mode (AI mode). The results indicate the capability of phenomena excitation and sensor arrangement. The sensitivity figure-of-merit (FOM) was achieved in the order of 160°/RIU, similar to the performance of traditional set-up for those biochips.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3229720","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq); Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido (UFERSA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989399","3-D printer sensor;portable sensor;Raspberry pi;single-board computer (SBC);surface plasmons resonance (SPRs)","Biochips;Lenses;Optical sensors;Biomedical optical imaging;Cameras;Optical imaging;Surface plasmons","biological techniques;biology computing;computerised instrumentation;diffractive optical elements;lab-on-a-chip;microcomputers;microsensors;optical couplers;optical prisms;optical sensors;portable instruments;Python;surface plasmon resonance;three-dimensional printing","3D printer;AI mode;angular interrogation mode;chassis piece;diffractive optical coupling element;DOCE;index-matching gels;optical elements;portable surface plasmons resonance sensor;prism BIOchip;Python-based embedded software;quick maintenance;Raspberry Pi 3 model B;Raspberry Pi SBC;rotational parts;SBC-SPR sensor;single-board computer;size 1.5 mm;size 3.0 mm;software implements algorithms;software resources;SPR responses;standalone portable SPR sensors","","","","46","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Roughly speaking, yet-to-come services will be offered in the automation scenario by industrial devices having an internet connection for sharing data in the cloud. Currently, most efforts are in the development of protocols able to ensure horizontal interoperability among heterogeneous applications. Consequently, poor attention is devoted to time-related performance. In this paper, a new, full software, platform-independent approach is proposed for experimentally evaluating the delay in transferring information across local and intercontinental routes by applications leveraging on messaging middleware. The application is realized using the node-RED web-based framework, due to its availability on different platforms; the widely accepted message queue telemetry transport protocol has been chosen thanks to its low overhead and complexity. For sake of completeness, five different, private and public, brokers are used. The adopted industrial-grade hardware, complemented by global positioning system time reference, permits an overall synchronization and timestamping accuracy of a few milliseconds. The vast measurement campaign highlighted that, generally, quality of service (QoS) type 1 offers low end-to-end delay (average value less than 0.5 s) with reduced variability (0.1 s). However, the maximum end-to-end one-way delay ranges from 1 s for QoS 0 to less than 1.5 s for fully acknowledged QoS 2.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2018.2813798","“Brescia Smart Living: Integrated Energy and Services for the Enhancement of the Welfare”(grant numbers:MIUR SCN00416); University of Brescia H&W(grant numbers:“AQMaSC.”); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330035","Automation networks;cloud computing;cloud manufacturing (CM);distributed measurement systems;Industry 4.0;Internet of Things (IoT);node-RED","Protocols;Delays;Industries;Cloud computing;Automation;Internet of Things;Quality of service","delay estimation;Internet;Internet of Things;middleware;open systems;production engineering computing;quality of service;telemetry;transport protocols","messaging protocols;operational technologies;automation scenario;industrial devices;horizontal interoperability;heterogeneous applications;platform-independent approach;messaging middleware;node-RED web-based framework;industrial-grade hardware;global positioning system time reference;delay estimation;industrial IoT applications;Internet connection;message queue telemetry transport protocol;end-to-end delay;QoS;information technologies;industrial Internet of Things;end-to-end one-way delay;Industry 4.0 paradigm;time 1.0 s;time 1.5 s;time 0.5 s;time 0.1 s","","85","","42","IEEE","3 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Palmieri and Pereira [1] demonstrated that delays in communication channels can be used as a reasonable and effective assumption to obtain an unconditionally secure oblivious transfer protocol against honest-but-curious adversaries. While any oblivious transfer protocol secure against malicious adversaries can be used to implement commitment, the reduction does not work if the oblivious transfer protocol is only secure against honest-but-curious adversaries. Thus, the question of obtaining a secure commitment protocol based on channel delays is still open.

Many of these attacks consist of stealing energy by manipulating smart meters' measurements. For example, a malicious entity can replace or tamper with components that execute measuring procedures and store sensitive parameters. This type of attack is common on devices, such as smart meters, that are part of environments considered hostile, where attackers have easy access to the device. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques in which physical manipulations on smart meters by attackers are unsuccessful. Our strategy uses physical properties from these components to create secure identities for the meter. We present two main contributions. The first one is inspired by physical unclonable functions and extracts unique identifiers from SRAM components. Then, we combine these identifiers to create a strong identity. The other contribution uses physical context information from the voltage levels in the smart meter's power supply to yield dynamic context identities. We also validate our proposals in experiments using a hardware prototype that embeds Arduino microprocessors, SRAM memories, and voltage sensors. The results show that our idea is suitable for implementation in real smart meters and can help protect these devices from attacks against their components.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3041098","Brazilian agency (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico) CNPq; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277921","Hardware protection;physical context (PC);physical unclonable function (PUF);physical-based identities;smart meters security","Smart meters;Meters;Security;Hardware;Random access memory;Software;Physical unclonable function","microprocessor chips;power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters;SRAM chips","smart meters;physical properties;critical electronic components;physical unclonable functions;unique identifiers;SRAM components;Arduino microprocessors;voltage sensors;physical manipulations","","5","","38","IEEE","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new procedure to harvest solar energy is using solar rectennas, which are composed of micro-sized antennas and nano diodes. This configuration allows the capture and conversion of electromagnetic energy into direct current. The challenges in developing this technology arise as the wave frequency increases to terahertz spectrum, causing metals to no longer exhibit perfect electrical conductivity (PEC) behavior, and diodes deviate from classical modeling, approaching more towards quantum model. Within this context, this work presents an investigative study on a novel solar rectenna designed to operate at 30 THz. It consists of a micro-bowtie antenna and a geometric diode, both constructed using graphene as conducting material. The antenna is designed using classical electromagnetic theory employing CST software. For the diode, a parametric study is conducted to seek the optimal I-V relationship. Given the complexity and time demands of quantum analysis, an approach utilizing the Monte Carlo method is proposed. The novelty of this approach lies in the time discretization process, triggered only when a collision occurs between the electrons and the rectifier boundaries.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2023.3330257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309213","Computational Modeling;Monte Carlo Simulations;Graphene;Energy Harvesting","Antennas;Mathematical models;Graphene;Monte Carlo methods;Rectifiers;Solar energy;Semiconductor diodes","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For the advancement of monitoring technology, harmonic synchrophasor estimation is still a challenge. To make it possible, it is necessary to correctly estimate the harmonic phasor (magnitude and phase of each harmonic component), mainly in scenarios with frequency deviations and noise. In this context, this present article proposes the use of B-spline-based interpolation as a preprocessing algorithm for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The performance is evaluated in terms of total vector error (TVE) considering the tests proposed by the IEEE C37.118.1 and IEC 60255-118-1 standards and compared with four different harmonic phasor estimation (HPE) methods, the HPE, sinc interpolation function-based estimator (SIFE), Taylor–Fourier transform (TFT), and flat-top finite impulse response (FT FIR). The proposed method can provide a TVE below 1% for all harmonic phasors, from the first to the fiftieth order, under significant frequency deviation. Also, for real-time validation, the proposed method was implemented in an industrial computer as a software routine capable of processing the signals in real time. The signals are acquired by a commercial merging unit (MU) and the samples are published using the IEC 61850 sampled values (SVs) protocol.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3175054","Federal University of Juiz de Fora; Research Supporting Foundation of Minas Gerais State (FAPEMING); National Institute of Science and Technology in Electrical Energy (INERGE); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9774376","B-spline interpolation;harmonic phasor estimation (HPE);phasor measurement unit (PMU);real time;resampling","Interpolation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Estimation;Power system harmonics;Harmonic analysis;Phasor measurement units;Real-time systems","discrete Fourier transforms;FIR filters;IEC standards;IEEE standards;interpolation;phasor measurement;power system measurement;splines (mathematics)","fundamental component synchrophasors;phasor measurement units;electrical power systems;harmonic synchrophasor estimation;frequency deviations;total vector error;HPE;interpolation function-based estimator;real-time B-spline interpolation;PMU;discrete Fourier transform;DFT;TVE;IEEE C37.118.1 standard;IEC 60255-118-1 standard;SIFE;Taylor-Fourier transform;TFT;flat-top finite impulse response;FT FIR;commercial merging unit","","2","","35","IEEE","13 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
