There are several electron loss (and efficiency) processes involved after photon absorption, but perhaps the main issue is with the electron recombination after excitation of the surface. In this paper, we have studied the dependence of short-circuit photocurrent of TiO2 nanotubes with varying amounts of CdS QDs deposited by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. We have found that there is an optimum coverage of CdS in order to achieve the maximum photocurrent value. This behavior is explained and characterized in terms of prevailing recombination processes at higher CdS coverage, where quantum confinement becomes less important. By using the charge extraction method, we could determine the time dependence of electrode charge and indicates that the back reaction of electrons with the redox electrolyte present in solution is of the first order in electron density and that it originates from the electrons present in the TiO2 conduction band.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2016.2611656","CONICET; Secretaría de Ciencia y Técnica, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (SeCyT UNC); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas; Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586104","Charge extraction;open circuit;solar cells;successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)","Titanium compounds;Photoconductivity;Nanotubes;Quantum dots;Cadmium compounds;Photovoltaic cells","cadmium compounds;conduction bands;II-VI semiconductors;nanotubes;photoconductivity;semiconductor quantum dots;solar cells;surface recombination;titanium compounds","charge extraction;nanotubes;SILAR method;quantum dot solar cells;electron loss;photon absorption;electron recombination;surface excitation;short circuit photocurrent;successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method;time dependence;electron density;conduction band;TiO2;CdS","","10","","24","IEEE","7 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on operational amplifiers and can be tailored to specific requirements such as low noise levels, low bias currents, or limited power supply voltages. The CM output voltage is controlled by a closed-loop scheme that results in a very good balance between circuit outputs.

In general, the photonic spin Hall effect leads to a polarization dependent transverse shift of a light peak intensity [3,4]. An example of the latter effect is the transverse Imbert-Federov beam shift [3], which happens for paraxial beams reflected or refracted at a sharp inhomogeneity of an isotropic optical interface. Potential applications of the photonic spin Hall effect in spin-dependent beam splitters, optical diodes [1], and surface sensors are considered in various fields in photonics, such as nanophotonics, plasmonics, metamaterials, topological optics, and quantum optics [1,2].","","978-1-7281-0469-0","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8872873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8872873","","Photonics;Hall effect;Optical sensors;Hidden Markov models;Adaptive optics;Optical device fabrication;Optical polarization","light polarisation;light reflection;light refraction;nanophotonics;optical beam splitters;optical metamaterials;quantum optics;refractive index;spin Hall effect","photonic spin Hall effect;geometric spin Hall effect;hyperbolic metamaterials;visible wavelengths;charge carriers;solid-state systems;light beam refraction;air-glass interface;oblique plane;polarization dependent transverse shift;light peak intensity;transverse Imbert-Federov beam shift;paraxial beams;isotropic optical interface;spin-dependent beam splitters;optical diodes;surface sensors","","","","6","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel fully differential biopotential amplifier is proposed with the goal of providing electrode offset rejection, bandwidth limitation, and a temporal response compliant with biomedical standards with only a single commercial quad operational amplifier (OA) integrated circuit. Methods: A novel compensation strategy was used to provide a transfer function with only one zero at the origin, which makes it easy to comply with the transient response imposed by biomedical standards. A topology with no grounded components was leveraged to obtain a common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) ideally infinite and independent of components mismatches. Results: Design equations are presented and, as an example, an electrocardiogram (ECG) amplifier was built and tested. It features a CMRR of 102 dB at 50 Hz, 53 dB gain that supports dc input voltages up to ±300 mV when powered from a 0 to 5-V single-supply voltage, and a cutoff frequency of less than 0.05 Hz with a first order response. Conclusion: A fully differential biopotential front-end was designed and validated through experimental tests, demonstrating proper operation with only 4 OAs. Significance: The amplifier is intended for board-level design solutions, it can be built with off-the-shelf components that can be selected according to specific needs, such as reduced power consumption, low noise, or proper operation from a low-voltage power source.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3220284","CONICET(grant numbers:PIP-0323); UNLP(grant numbers:I254,PPID/I014); Agencia I+D+i(grant numbers:PICT 2018-03747); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940971","Biopotential measurements;electrode offset potentials;fully differential amplifiers","Transient response;Topology;Gain;Equivalent circuits;Transfer functions;Standards;Electrodes","biomedical electrodes;biomedical electronics;CMOS integrated circuits;differential amplifiers;electrocardiography;low-power electronics;medical signal processing;operational amplifiers","5-V single-supply voltage;53 dB gain;bandwidth limitation;biomedical standards;CMRR;common-mode rejection ratio;compensation strategy;cutoff frequency;dc input voltages;ECG;electrocardiogram amplifier;electrode offset rejection;frequency 50.0 Hz;fully differential biopotential front-end;fully differential topologies;fully-differential biopotential amplifier;grounded components;low-voltage power source;order response;portable wearable devices;reduced power consumption;single commercial quad operational amplifier integrated circuit;single-supply battery-powered circuits;temporal response compliant;transfer function;transient response;voltage 0 V to 5 V","","","","27","IEEE","7 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An overall good agreement between experiment and theory corroborates the effectiveness of the Lang-Kobayashi model, though the model underestimates the entropy on the timescale of the relaxation oscillations and can lead to a time-delay signature that is less evident than in experiment, indicating a potential vulnerability of chaos encryption.

However, this depends on the pumping condition as well as some key parameters. For example, the reported hybrid pumping consisting of standard electrical pumping and polarized light pulse excitation only results in damped high-frequency birefringence-induced oscillations. Here we focus on the optically pumped spin-VCSELs which have not been fully understood compared to those under hybrid pumping. We consider both periodic and continuous-wave (CW) regimes for exploiting high-frequency operation. In the periodic regime, the regions of period-one (P1) oscillations are identified via bifurcation diagrams and peak amplitude curves/maps, where the dependence on some key parameters is systematically studied. In the CW regime, we explore the high-frequency polarization modulation. In particular, double peak response curves are found when spin-VCSELs are pumped with a certain polarization degree and the RO frequency related peak in the frequency response curve is extremely sensitive to the variation of the polarization degree, which leads to rich modulation dynamics in spin-VCSELs. Additionally, the effects of the spin relaxation rate on the polarization modulation bandwidth are illustrated by using two-parameter bandwidth maps. These findings help us better understand the underlying high-frequency dynamics of the optically pumped spin-VCSELs.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2021.3111399","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62004135,62001317); Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions(grant numbers:20KJA416001,20KJB510011); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200855); Project of Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Ministry of Education(grant numbers:RIMP2020001); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (IPOC), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)(grant numbers:IPOC2020A012); Startup Funding of Soochow University(grant numbers:Q415900119); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9531604","Vertical-Cavity surface-emitting lasers;birefringence;high-frequency;polarization oscillation","Optical pumping;Optical polarization;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Oscillators;Bandwidth;High-speed optical techniques;Bifurcation","bifurcation;birefringence;laser cavity resonators;light polarisation;optical modulation;optical pumping;quantum well lasers;surface emitting lasers","spin-polarized vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers;high-frequency continuous birefringence-induced oscillations;pumping condition;hybrid pumping;polarized light pulse excitation;continuous-wave regimes;high-frequency operation;period-one oscillations;high-frequency polarization modulation;polarization degree;RO frequency related peak;frequency response curve;spin relaxation rate;polarization modulation bandwidth;high-frequency dynamics;optically pumped spin-VCSEL;high-frequency polarization oscillations;relaxation oscillation mechanism;standard electrical pumping;damped high-frequency birefringence-induced oscillations;bifurcation diagrams;peak amplitude curve-maps;double peak response curves;modulation dynamics;two-parameter bandwidth maps","","7","","58","IEEE","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system can stream data at rates up to 1 MS/s and allows multiplexed processing up to two channels. Experimental results show simultaneous measurements of two FBGs, one of which was actuated at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The system features a 3-dB bandwidth of 280 kHz, and a dynamic wavelength resolution of 4.7 fm/Hz $^{\mathrm {1/2}}$ . We also demonstrate a strong reduction of distortion using the MTM approach with respect to the standard technique. Finally, we study the origin of the noise, demonstrating a reduction in common noise sources by using one of the FBGs as a reference. The system can measure FBGs centered at any position within the spectral band of the source, is polarization-independent, and is easily scalable to more than two measurement channels from the same interferometer.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3165291","Italian Space Agency [Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI)] through the Project Photonic Real-Time Analyzer for Distributed Monitoring in Aerospace (ARTEMIDE), within the initiative “Nuove idee per la Componentistica Spaziale del Futuro TRL.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751594","Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs);interferometers;optical fiber sensors;phase demodulation;phase-generated carrier (PGC);strain sensors;vibration sensors","Sagnac interferometers;Optical interferometry;Optical fibers;Modulation;Optical fiber sensors;Fiber gratings;Optical polarization","Bragg gratings;demodulation;fibre optic sensors;field programmable gate arrays;light interferometers;light interferometry;optical fibres","multitone mixing;distortion-free signals;modulation depth variations;light intensity fluctuations;rates up to 1 MS;multiplexed processing up to two channels;FBGs;frequencies up to 100 kHz;FPGA-based high-speed optical fiber sensor;multitone-mixing interferometry;real-time high-speed fiber Bragg grating interrogator;fiber-optic interferometer;signal processing;low-cost field-programmable gate array system;phase-generated carrier demodulation algorithm;wavelength 4.7 fm;frequency 100.0 kHz;frequency 280.0 kHz","","7","","15","CCBY","7 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A detailed presentation of the formulation of both the cost functions and constraints is included for the positive-sequence phasor estimation problem. The design method is extremely powerful and flexible as it allows to control precisely the behavior of the system in terms of the total vector error (TVE), frequency error (FE), and rate of change of frequency error (RFE) metrics for several different scenarios. This feature is extremely useful for tailored designs of these filters for different applications. We also determine numerically the uniform feasibility limits of the system as a function of the filter lengths and, in particular, study the required filter lengths for compliance with the IEEE Standards C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014. It is found that all requirements can be achieved with a significant margin with the exception of the M class FE constraint for interharmonic components, an issue which is also reported in other works and briefly discussed here.

The development allows for an improvement in the measurement capacity of the laboratories when calibrating electronic levels, reference planes, and angular patterns, among others. On the other hand, fundamental information is provided for the new instrument's last stage of design through a detailed evaluation of the measurement system's mathematical model.

The characterization of the system has been performed by means of a statistical study, considering different numbers of beacons, beacons' position and physical phenomena, such as noise, multipath, and Doppler spread. The error propagation caused by these phenomena and the geometrical configuration of the system has been quantitatively assessed in different positioning algorithms, based on trilateration and iterative procedures. The results show how the different phenomena affect the vehicle estimated position errors for the different positioning algorithms.
