In this scenario, the idea of automating the design of such complex networks has inspired many researchers. New algorithms have been proposed to address the neural architecture search problem, but computational cost is a major drawback. Q-NAS (Quantum-inspired Neural Architecture Search) is an evolutionary algorithm recently proposed with the idea of improving efficiency, but with minor humanbias introduced in the search. This work extends the analysis of Q-NAS, focusing on fitness behavior during evolution. We want to verify if good individuals are obtained early in evolution, so we could apply an early-stopping mechanism. We experiment with a simple early-stopping technique, and results indicated an evolution time reduction of more than 45% in most cases. This new feature can improve efficiency, making Q-NAS very competitive compared to other algorithms.","2643-6264","978-1-7281-4253-1","10.1109/BRACIS.2019.00095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8923858","Neural architecture search, evolutionary algorithms, deep learning, quantum inspired algorithms","Sociology;Statistics;Computer architecture;Training;Evolutionary computation;Quantum computing;Probability density function","evolutionary computation;neural net architecture;quantum computing;search problems","neural architecture search problem;computational cost;quantum-inspired neural architecture search;evolutionary algorithm;fitness behavior;early-stopping mechanism;simple early-stopping technique;evolution time reduction;Q-NAS;evolution fitness;scientific community;deep neural networks;expert knowledge;complex networks","","2","","27","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identification and synthesis of TLF are essential tasks in a design flow based on such a logic strategy. The proposed method relies on irredundant sum-of-products Boolean function description form and exploits both ordering of variables and system of inequalities to assign the variable weights and the function threshold value. This is the first heuristic algorithm able to identify all threshold functions with up to six variables, being also more effective than other heuristic methods for functions with a larger number of variables. For functions obtained from k -cuts of benchmark circuits, experimental results demonstrated effectiveness near to 100% when compared to exact methods, even when the number of function variables increases. The execution time of the proposed approach is similar to related heuristic methods, being faster than integer linear programming-based algorithms.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2729403","Brazilian funding agencies CAPES, CNPq, and FAPERGS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7984837","Digital circuit;linear separable function;threshold functions;threshold logic gate;threshold logic identification","Logic gates;Logic functions;Integrated circuit reliability;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis","Boolean functions;logic design;threshold logic","conventional Boolean logic;design flow;logic strategy;sum-of-products Boolean function description form;variable weights;function threshold value;threshold logic function identification;TLF identification;TLF synthesis;effective heuristic method;benchmark circuits","","6","","30","IEEE","19 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even worse, emerging technologies and process improvements, without reversible techniques, cannot solve this problem. Approaches such as field-coupled nanocomputing allow computations near the fundamental energy limits. However, there is a demand for strategies that avoid information losses within logic gates, consequently improving energy efficiency. For that end, we propose a novel way to reduce such losses by embedding fan-outs in logic gates, making them partially reversible. Simulation results for state-of-the-art benchmarks indicate an average reduction of the fundamental energy limit by 44% without affecting the delay. If delay is not the main concern, the average reduction reaches even 77%.

The proposed method allows for an instantaneous tracking of the power components defined in CPC power theory based on a time–frequency analysis provided by the DST. Thus, the proposed method is able to identify alterations in the harmonic content, and consequently track variations on the powers, in all time instants. The proposed method is validated using non-stationary signals, including a scenario with frequency deviation, presenting rather promising results when compared to the Fourier-based approach.

In addition, face pattern representation often requires several dimensions, which poses additional challenges for face recognition. We propose a novel face recognition method based on projections of high-dimensional face image representations into lower dimensionality and highly discriminative spaces. This is achieved by a modified orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) method that uses a customized locality definition scheme to preserve the face class structure in the lower dimensionality face feature space. The proposed method can work with sparse and dense face image representations (i.e., it can use subsets or all face image pixels) and tends to be robust to data outliers and noise. Besides, we introduce a sparse representation using interpolated landmarks, designed to preserve important details in high-resolution color face images (e.g., eyes), and compensate for uncertainties in landmark positioning during face image feature extraction. The face images are classified in this lower dimensionality feature space using a trained soft-margin support vector machine, so it performs better than the nearest neighbor rule used in the typical OLPP method. A set of experiments was designed to evaluate the proposed scheme under various conditions found in practice (such as changes in head pose, face expression, illumination, and in the presence of occlusion artifacts). The experimental results were obtained using five challenging public face databases (namely, Poznan University of Technology, Fundação Educacional Inaciana, Facial Recognition Technology, Yale, and Our Database of Faces). These experiments suggest that our sparse representation for high-resolution face color images, integrated to the proposed lower dimensionality feature space and classification scheme, tends to obtain higher accuracy values than those obtained using typical sparse and dense representations for the same face images in grayscale. To evaluate the generality of our lower dimensionality feature space and classification scheme, additional tests using full low-resolution grayscale face images were performed, as often used in face recognition (e.g., typical OLPP method).

Some examples of thermoelectric energy harvesting applications are in the human body, wearable devices, and aircraft. However, several studies and development steps are previously needed to build a complete thermal harvester to prove whether it can generate a useful amount of energy. In this context, a way to early verify the potential of a possible thermal source before building the thermal harvester is needed to save either time or funding resources. In this article, a complete system to verify the capabilities of thermal sources before building the final thermal harvester is presented. The proposed system runs a procedure of simultaneous sampling and emulating thermal gradients, that is, while the temperature gradient of the thermal source under test (TSUV) is sampled, the system emulates this gradient and applies it on a TEG, which can predict the potential of the TSUV. In addition, using long-range-based wireless connectivity, the proposed system operates remotely, meaning that the temperature gradient sampling process can be far away from the temperature gradient emulation process, allowing to evaluate thermal sources in very hard spots, for instance, inside building structures or faraway pipelines. Experimental results show the emulation of two potential thermal sources, namely, tree trunks and the back surface of the photovoltaic modules.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.2986105","National Institute of Science and Technology of Micro and Nanoelectronics Systems (INCT NAMITEC)(grant numbers:573738/2008-4); Maranhão ResearchFoundation (FAPEMA)(grant numbers:01550/16); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil(grant numbers:309371/2019-8PQ); Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program (PIBIC) of Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), Brazil; Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES Scholarship); PNPD CAPES, Brazil(grant numbers:PNPD 2878/2011); CNPq, Brazil; State Funding Agency of Paraíba/Brazil—FAPESQ-PRONEX; University of Washington Tacoma (UWT) Endowment in Engineering Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057629","Energy harvesting;Internet of Things;remote sensing;thermoelectricity","Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Temperature measurement;Emulation;Energy harvesting;Remote sensing;Vegetation","building management systems;energy harvesting;solar cell arrays;thermoelectric conversion","simultaneous sampling;emulating thermal gradients;temperature gradient sampling process;photovoltaic modules;back surface;tree trunks;faraway pipelines;long-range-based wireless connectivity;building structures;wearable devices;human body;thermal harvester;electrical energy;thermoelectric generators;thermoelectric energy harvesting applications;online remote verification system;thermal sources;temperature gradient emulation process","","7","","34","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these machines are often exposed to mechanical and electrical failures that can cause unexpected stoppages. Among these failures, the voltage unbalance (VU) is a supply fault that can lead to winding wear, torque losses, overheating, and other side effects. In this context, the acoustic emission (AE) analysis stands out as a promising nondestructive technique (NDT) in TIM monitoring. However, the AE method was not previously completely validated for VU diagnosis, and several research gaps need to be filled. Therefore, this work proposes a novel AE approach for detection, phase identification, and magnitude classification of VU. For this purpose, an electrical machine monitored by piezoelectric sensors was subjected to different levels of unbalanced voltages. The AE signals were processed using the novel zero-cross-weighted energy (ZE) index. This metric was based on the energy of the wavelet transform (WT) coefficients weighted by zero-crossing rate values. Experimental results revealed that the proposed index proved to be effective for detecting the VU occurrence. Besides, ZE-based data separation was proposed and achieved VU phase identification. Finally, the magnitude of the unbalanced voltages was classified by linear regression. The accuracy parameters for detection, phase identification, and magnitude classification stated the reliability of the new approach. Finally, the efforts of this work provide new functionalities to traditional AE systems.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3047492","Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement Personnel(grant numbers:#88882.432803/2019-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9308973","Acoustic emission (AE);fault diagnosis;induction motor;piezoelectric sensors;wavelet transform (WT);zero-crossing-weighted energy","Indexes;Sensors;Feature extraction;Induction motors;Monitoring;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wavelet analysis","acoustic emission;condition monitoring;electric machines;fault diagnosis;induction motors;nondestructive testing;power supply quality;regression analysis;sensors;wavelet transforms","zero-cross-weighted energy index;nondestructive technique;acoustic emission analysis;torque losses;winding wear;supply fault;voltage unbalance;unexpected stoppages;electrical failures;mechanical failures;production lines;three-phase induction motor;supply disturbances evaluation;acoustic emission;VU phase identification;ZE-based data separation;VU occurrence;unbalanced voltages;electrical machine;magnitude classification;VU diagnosis;TIM monitoring","","12","","63","IEEE","25 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Normally, a failure in the material under these conditions does not occur immediately, but over time, different degradation processes emerge and evolve, progressively deteriorating the insulation, until breakdown occurs, and consequently, the asset finishes its operation with a catastrophic failure. In this context, partial discharge (PD) measurement can be considered as one of the best indicators when diagnosing the status of much electrical equipment in operation. However, the simultaneous presence of noise sources or multiple PD sources can generate important difficulties in identifying the type or types of sources measured. These practical limitations can be solved if, prior to the identification, a separation process is carried out, which allows classifying the different sources acting over the equipment being monitored. Once the sources separation is executed, the subsequent identification and diagnosis process can be carried out more easily. In this article, we present a novel separation technique based on the temporal and spectral behavior of the PD signals. For this technique, the separation of sources is carried out through three different parameters. Two of them are based on the peakedness of PD signals and electrical noise, and the third parameter is associated with their spectral content. Based on these parameters, a 3-D separation map is established, representing in clusters each source captured by the sensors.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3121488","Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)(grant numbers:1200055); Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico(grant numbers:ID19I10165); Federico Santa Maria Technical University (UTFSM)(grant numbers:PI_m_19_01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580910","Clustering;electrical noise;kurtosis;monopole antenna;partial discharge (PD);separation map;skewness","Partial discharges;Histograms;Three-dimensional displays;Separation processes;Corona;Noise measurement;Monitoring","ageing;cable insulation;electric machines;partial discharge measurement;partial discharges","cables;electrical noise;PD signals;spectral behavior;temporal behavior;sources separation;noise sources;electrical equipment;partial discharge measurement;catastrophic failure;environmental aging;thermal aging;mechanical aging;electrical aging;electrical machines;insulation systems","","6","","28","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, concerns arise as many of these assets have surpassed their useful life or are nearing the end of it. For this reason, the monitoring and diagnosis of failures in liquid insulation systems play an important role when it comes to extending the life of these pieces of equipment. In its current state, the measurement systems used to capture and quantify the evolution of gases have limitations hindering their widespread use in routine measurements. These limitations have forced a large part of the research and development efforts to focus on developing and proposing new forms of measurement that can be applied without any type of technical-economic restriction and still provide a much more accurate diagnosis of the failure. This article introduces a novel system that utilizes an electronic nose (E-nose) equipped with eight metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)-type gas sensors to measure dissolved gases in liquid insulation systems. The obtained results validate the system’s exceptional performance in differentiating mineral oil samples based on the type and concentration of the predominant gases. This innovative approach shows great promise for routine monitoring and diagnosis, offering an efficient and cost-effective solution.
