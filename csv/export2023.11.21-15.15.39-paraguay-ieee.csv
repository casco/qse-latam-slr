"A multiobjective approach to linear nearest neighbor optimization for 2D quantum circuits","D. Ruffinelli; B. Baran","Catholic University of Asuncion, Paraguay; Catholic University of Asuncion, National University of Asuncion (UNA), Paraguay","2016 XLII Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI)","26 Jan 2017","2016","","","1","8","The linear nearest neighbor (LNN) restriction, present in several current implementations of 1D and 2D quantum circuits, limits the interaction of qubits to those which are adjacent to each other. While there have been several proposals to optimize the process of achieving LNN compliance in 1D circuits, there are few proposals for 2D circuits. Here, we present a new perspective on this problem for 2D quantum circuits. We propose to see this as a multiobjective optimization problem with two objectives: minimizing the size of the 2D grid in the circuit, and minimizing the number of SWAP gates required to achieve LNN compliance. We present some preliminary results which show that these are two contradictory objectives. Since this is common in multiobjective problems, these results indicate that a multiobjective algorithm might be a suitable way to address this problem, since it would make considerations which currently available methods do not make.","","978-1-5090-1633-4","10.1109/CLEI.2016.7833378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833378","linear nearest neighbor;LNN;quantum circuit;multiobjective","Logic gates;Two dimensional displays;Quantum computing;Optimization;Proposals;Algorithm design and analysis;Equivalent circuits","logic gates;minimisation;quantum computing","linear nearest neighbor optimization;2D quantum circuits;LNN;1D quantum circuits;multiobjective optimization problem;2D grid;SWAP gates","","2","","31","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Comparison of two types of quantum oracles based on Grover's adaptative search algorithm for multiobjective optimization problems","G. G. Fogel; B. Baran; M. Villagra","National University of Asuncion, Asuncion, Paraguay; National University of Asuncion, Asuncion, Paraguay; National University of Asuncion, Asuncion, Paraguay","2017 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","13 Nov 2017","2017","","","421","428","Quantum Computing is a field of study in computer science based on the laws of quantum physics. Quantum computing is an attractive subject considering that quantum algorithms proved to be more efficient than classical algorithms and the advent of large-scale quantum computation. In particular, Grover's search algorithm is a quantum algorithm that is asymptotically faster than any classical search algorithm and it is relevant for the design of fast optimization algorithms. This article proposes two algorithms based on Grover's adaptative search for biobjective optimization problems where access to the objective functions is given via two different quantum oracles. The proposed algorithms, considering both types of oracles, are compared against NSGA-II, a highly cited multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm. Experimental evidence suggests that the quantum optimization methods proposed in this work are at least as effective as NSGA-II in average, considering an equal number of executions. Experimental results showed which oracle required less iterations for similar effectiveness.","","978-83-946253-7-5","10.15439/2017F259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104576","","Quantum computing;Optimization;Linear programming;Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Search problems;Electronic mail","genetic algorithms;quantum computing;search problems","quantum computing;computer science;quantum physics;quantum algorithm;large-scale quantum computation;Grover's search algorithm;classical search algorithm;biobjective optimization problems;highly cited multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm;quantum optimization methods;Grover's adaptative search algorithm;quantum oracles","","1","","11","","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
